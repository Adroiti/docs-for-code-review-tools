Pattern: Use of `inputs` metadata property

Issue: -

## Description

- It is easier and more readable to identify which properties in a class are inputs.
- If you ever need to rename the property associated with `@Input`, you can modify it in a single place.
- The metadata declaration attached to the directive is shorter and thus more readable.
