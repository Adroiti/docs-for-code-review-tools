Pattern: Missing JSDoc

Issue: -

## Description

Deprecated - This rule can be replaced with TSLint's `file-header` rule.

All files must have a top level [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) comment.
A JSDoc comment starts with `**` (not one more or one less asterisk)
and a JSDoc at the 'top-level' appears without leading spaces. Trailing
spaces are acceptable but not recommended
