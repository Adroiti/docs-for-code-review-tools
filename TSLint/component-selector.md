Pattern: Invalid component selector name

Issue: -

## Description

Component selectors should follow given naming rules.

- Consistent conventions make it easy to quickly identify and reference assets of different types.
- Makes it easier to promote and share the component in other apps.
- Components are easy to identify in the DOM.
- Keeps the element names consistent with the specification for Custom Elements.
- Components have templates containing HTML and optional Angular template syntax.
- They display content. Developers place components on the page as they would native HTML elements and WebComponents.
- It is easier to recognize that a symbol is a component by looking at the templateâ€™s HTML.
