Pattern: Use of `OpenStruct.new`

Issue: -

## Description

This cop checks for `OpenStruct.new` calls.
Instantiation of an `OpenStruct` invalidates
Ruby global method cache as it causes dynamic method
definition during program runtime.
This could have an effect on performance,
especially in case of single-threaded
applications with multiple `OpenStruct` instantiations.

### Examples

```ruby
# bad
class MyClass
  def my_method
    OpenStruct.new(my_key1: 'my_value1', my_key2: 'my_value2')
  end
end

# good
class MyClass
  MyStruct = Struct.new(:my_key1, :my_key2)
  def my_method
    MyStruct.new('my_value1', 'my_value2')
  end
end
```
