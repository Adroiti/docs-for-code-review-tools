Pattern: Misaligned multi-line block

Issue: -

## Description

This rule checks whether the multi-line `do..end` blocks have a newline
after the start of the block. Additionally, it checks whether the block
arguments, if any, are on the same line as the start of the block.

## Examples

```ruby
# bad
blah do |i| foo(i)
  bar(i)
end

# bad
blah do
  |i| foo(i)
  bar(i)
end

# good
blah do |i|
  foo(i)
  bar(i)
end

# bad
blah { |i| foo(i)
  bar(i)
}

# good
blah { |i|
  foo(i)
  bar(i)
}
```
