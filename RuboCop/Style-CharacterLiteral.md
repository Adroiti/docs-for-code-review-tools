Pattern: Use of `?` character literal

Issue: -

## Description

Checks for uses of the character literal `?x`. Since Ruby 1.9 it's basically redundant â€” `?x` would interpreted as `'x'` (a string with a single character in it).

## Examples

```ruby
# bad
char = ?c

# good
char = 'c'
```
