Pattern: Ambiguous RegExp literal

Issue: -

## Description

This rule checks for ambiguous RegExp literals in the first argument of a method invocation without parentheses.

## Examples

```ruby
# bad

# This is interpreted as a method invocation with a RegExp literal,
# but it could possibly be `/` method invocations.
# (i.e. `do_something./(pattern)./(i)`)
do_something /pattern/i
```
```ruby
# good

# With parentheses, there's no ambiguity.
do_something(/pattern/i)
```
