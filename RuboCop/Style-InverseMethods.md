Pattern: Use of `!.method` inverse

Issue: -

## Description

This rule check for usages of not (`not` or `!`) called on a method
when an inverse of that method can be used instead.
Methods that can be inverted by a not (`not` or `!`) should be defined
in `InverseMethods`
Methods that are inverted by inverting the return
of the block that is passed to the method should be defined in
`InverseBlocks`

## Examples

```ruby
# bad
!foo.none?
!foo.any? { |f| f.even? }
!foo.blank?
!(foo == bar)
foo.select { |f| !f.even? }
foo.reject { |f| f != 7 }

# good
foo.none?
foo.blank?
foo.any? { |f| f.even? }
foo != bar
foo == bar
!!('foo' =~ /^\w+$/)
```

## Default configuration

Attribute | Value
--- | ---
InverseMethods | {:any?=>:none?, :even?=>:odd?, :===>:!=, :=~=>:!~, :<=>:>=, :>=>:<=}
InverseBlocks | {:select=>:reject, :select!=>:reject!}
