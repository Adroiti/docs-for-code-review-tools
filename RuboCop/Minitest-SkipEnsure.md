Pattern: Use of `ensure` for skipped test

Issue: -

## Description

It is unexpected that `ensure` will be called when skipping test. If conditional `skip` is used, it checks that `ensure` is also called conditionally.

On the other hand, it accepts `skip` used in `rescue` because `ensure`
may be teardown process to `begin` setup process.

## Examples

``` ruby
# bad
def test_skip
  skip 'This test is skipped.'

  assert 'foo'.present?
ensure
  do_something
end

# bad
def test_conditional_skip
  skip 'This test is skipped.' if condition

  assert do_something
ensure
  do_teardown
end

# good
def test_skip
  skip 'This test is skipped.'

  begin
    assert 'foo'.present?
  ensure
    do_something
  end
end

# good
def test_conditional_skip
  skip 'This test is skipped.' if condition

  assert do_something
ensure
  if condition
    do_teardown
  end
end

# good
def test_skip_is_used_in_rescue
  do_setup
  assert do_something
rescue
  skip 'This test is skipped.'
ensure
  do_teardown
end
```
