Pattern: Unnecessary `''` or `,` in `%w`

Issue: -

## Description

This rule checks for quotes and commas in `%w`, e.g. `%w('foo', "bar")`

It is more likely that the additional characters are unintended (for
example, mistranslating an array of literals to percent string notation)
rather than meant to be part of the resulting strings.

## Examples

```ruby
# bad

%w('foo', "bar")
```
```ruby
# good

%w(foo bar)
```
