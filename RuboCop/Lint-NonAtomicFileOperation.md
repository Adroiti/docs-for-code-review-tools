Pattern: Use of non-atomic file operation

Issue: -

## Description

Checks for non-atomic file operation. And then replace it with a nearly equivalent and atomic method.

These can cause problems that are difficult to reproduce, especially in cases of frequent file operations in parallel, such as test runs with parallel_rspec.

For examples: creating a directory if there is none, has the following problems

An exception occurs when the directory didnâ€™t exist at the time of `exist?`, but someone else created it before mkdir was executed.

Subsequent processes are executed without the directory that should be there when the directory existed at the time of `exist?`, but someone else deleted it shortly afterwards.


## Examples

```ruby
# bad
unless FileTest.exist?(path)
  FileUtils.makedirs(path)
end

if FileTest.exist?(path)
  FileUtils.remove(path)
end

# good
FileUtils.mkdir_p(path)

FileUtils.rm_rf(path)
```
