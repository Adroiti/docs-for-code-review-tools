Pattern: Unreachable assertion

Issue: -

## Description

Checks for `assert_raises` has an assertion method at the bottom of
block because the assertion will be never reached.

## Examples

``` ruby
# bad
assert_raises FooError do
  obj.occur_error
  assert_equal('foo', obj.bar) # Never asserted.
end

# good
assert_raises FooError do
  obj.occur_error
end
assert_equal('foo', obj.bar)
```
