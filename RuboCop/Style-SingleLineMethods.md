Pattern: Single-line method definition

Issue: -

## Description

This rule checks for single-line method definitions. It can optionally accept single-line methods with no body.

## Examples

```ruby
# bad
def too_much; something; something_else; end

# okish - notice that the first ; is required
def no_braces_method; body end

# okish - notice that the second ; is optional
def no_braces_method; body; end

# okish - valid syntax, but no ; makes it kind of hard to read
def some_method() body end

# good
def some_method
  body
end
```

## Default configuration

Attribute | Value
--- | ---
AllowIfMethodIsEmpty | true
