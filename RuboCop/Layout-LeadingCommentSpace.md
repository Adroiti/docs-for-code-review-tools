Pattern: Missing space after `#`

Issue: -

## Description

This rule checks whether comments have a leading space after the
`#` denoting the start of the comment. The leading space is not
required for some RDoc special syntax, like `#++`, `#--`,
`#:nodoc`, `=begin`- and `=end` comments, "shebang" directives,
or rackup options.

## Examples

```ruby
# bad
#Some comment

# good
# Some comment
```
