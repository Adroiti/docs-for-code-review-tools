Pattern: Cloudtrail should be encrypted at rest to secure access to sensitive trail data

Issue: -

## Description

Cloudtrail logs should be encrypted at rest to secure the sensitive data. Cloudtrail logs record all activity that occurs in the the account through API calls and would be one of the first places to look when reacting to a breach.

**Resolution**: Enable encryption at rest.

## Examples

Example of **incorrect** code:

```terraform
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "bad_example" {
  is_multi_region_trail = true

  event_selector {
    read_write_type           = "All"
    include_management_events = true

    data_resource {
      type = "AWS::S3::Object"
      values = ["${data.aws_s3_bucket.important-bucket.arn}/"]
    }
  }
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```terraform
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "good_example" {
  is_multi_region_trail = true
  enable_log_file_validation = true
  kms_key_id = var.kms_id

  event_selector {
    read_write_type           = "All"
    include_management_events = true

    data_resource {
      type = "AWS::S3::Object"
      values = ["${data.aws_s3_bucket.important-bucket.arn}/"]
    }
  }
}
```
