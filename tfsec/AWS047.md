Pattern: AWS SQS policy document has wildcard action statement

Issue: -

## Description

SQS Policy actions should always be restricted to a specific set.

This ensures that the queue itself cannot be modified or deleted, and prevents possible future additions to queue actions to be implicitly allowed.

**Resolution**: Keep policy scope to the minimum that is required to be effective.

## Examples

Example of **incorrect** code:

```terraform
resource "aws_sqs_queue_policy" "bad_example" {
  queue_url = aws_sqs_queue.q.id

  policy = <<POLICY
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "*"
    }
  ]
}
POLICY
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```terraform
resource "aws_sqs_queue_policy" "good_example" {
  queue_url = aws_sqs_queue.q.id

  policy = <<POLICY
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "sqs:SendMessage"
    }
  ]
}
POLICY
}
```
