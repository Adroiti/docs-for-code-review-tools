Pattern: AWS IAM policy document has wildcard action statement

Issue: -

## Description

IAM profiles should be configured with the specific, minimum set of permissions required.

**Resolution**: Keep policy scope to the minimum that is required to be effective.

## Examples

Example of **incorrect** code:

```terraform
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "bad_example" {
	statement {
		sid = "1"

        actions = [
      		"*"
    	]
	}
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```terraform
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "good_example" {
	statement {
		sid = "1"

        actions = [
      		"s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
      		"ec2:DescribeInstances"
    	]
	}
}
```
