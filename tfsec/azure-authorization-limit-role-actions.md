Pattern: Missing use of targeted permissions for Azure roles

Issue: -

## Description

The permissions granted to a role should be kept to the minimum required to be able to do the task. Wildcard permissions must not be used.

**Resolution**: Use targeted permissions for roles.

## Examples

Example of **incorrect** code:

```terraform
data "azurerm_subscription" "primary" {
}

resource "azurerm_role_definition" "example" {
  name        = "my-custom-role"
  scope       = data.azurerm_subscription.primary.id
  description = "This is a custom role created via Terraform"

  permissions {
    actions     = ["*"]
    not_actions = []
  }

  assignable_scopes = [
    "/"
  ]
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```terraform
data "azurerm_subscription" "primary" {
}

resource "azurerm_role_definition" "example" {
  name        = "my-custom-role"
  scope       = data.azurerm_subscription.primary.id
  description = "This is a custom role created via Terraform"

  permissions {
    actions     = ["*"]
    not_actions = []
  }

  assignable_scopes = [
    data.azurerm_subscription.primary.id,
  ]
}
```
