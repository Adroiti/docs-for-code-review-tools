Pattern: Disabled logging for Azure Queue Services

Issue: -

## Description

Storage Analytics logs detailed information about successful and failed requests to a storage service. 

This information can be used to monitor individual requests and to diagnose issues with a storage service. 

Requests are logged on a best-effort basis.

**Resolution**: Enable logging for Queue Services.

## Examples

Example of **incorrect** code:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "bad_example" {
    name                     = "example"
    resource_group_name      = data.azurerm_resource_group.example.name
    location                 = data.azurerm_resource_group.example.location
    account_tier             = "Standard"
    account_replication_type = "GRS"
    queue_properties  {
  }
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "good_example" {
    name                     = "example"
    resource_group_name      = data.azurerm_resource_group.example.name
    location                 = data.azurerm_resource_group.example.location
    account_tier             = "Standard"
    account_replication_type = "GRS"
    queue_properties  {
    logging {
        delete                = true
        read                  = true
        write                 = true
        version               = "1.0"
        retention_policy_days = 10
    }
  }
}
```
