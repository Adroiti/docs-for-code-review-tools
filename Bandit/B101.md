Pattern: Avoid use of `assert` keyword

Issue: -

## Description

`assert` is removed with compiling to optimized byte code (`python -o` producing `*.pyo` files). This causes various protections to be removed. It was discovered that some projects used `assert` to enforce interface constraints. Consider raising a semantically meaningful error or `AssertionError` instead.


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
assert logged_in
display_assets()
```

Example of **secure** code:

```python
if logged_in:
  display_assets()
```
