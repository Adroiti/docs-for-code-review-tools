Pattern: Use of insecure `lxml.etree` module

Issue: -

## Description

This module is not secure against maliciously constructed data. Use `defusedxml` package instead.

The results of an attack on a vulnerable XML library can be fairly dramatic. With just a few hundred Bytes of XML data an attacker can occupy several Gigabytes of memory within seconds. An attacker can also keep CPUs busy for a long time with a small to medium size request. Under some circumstances it is even possible to access local files on your server, to circumvent a firewall, or to abuse services to rebound attacks to third parties.

This rule checks for the following calls:

  - `lxml.etree.parse`
  - `lxml.etree.fromstring`
  - `lxml.etree.RestrictedElement`
  - `lxml.etree.GlobalParserTLS`
  - `lxml.etree.getDefaultParser`
  - `lxml.etree.check_docinfo`


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
import lxml.etree
import lxml

xmlString = "<note>malicious data</note>"
root = lxml.etree.fromstring(xmlString)
```

Example of **secure** code:

```python
from defusedxml.lxml import fromstring

xmlString = "<note>malicious data</note>"
root = fromstring(xmlString)
```
