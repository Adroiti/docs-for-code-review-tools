Pattern: Use of hard-coded password function arguments

Issue: -

## Description

The use of hard-coded passwords increases the possibility of password guessing
tremendously. This rule looks for all function calls being passed a
keyword argument that is a string literal. It checks that the assigned local
variable does not look like a password.

Variables are considered to look like a password if they have match any one
of:

  - `password`
  - `pass`
  - `passwd`
  - `pwd`
  - `secret`
  - `token`
  - `secrete`

Note: this can be noisy and may generate false positives.


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
doLogin(password="1234")
```
