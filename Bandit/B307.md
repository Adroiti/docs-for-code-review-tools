Pattern: Avoid using `eval()` when possible

Issue: -

## Description

Used when you use the `eval()` function, to discourage its usage. It's usage may have negative readability, performance and security implications, especially if you accept strings from untrusted or unknown sources. Consider using `ast.literal_eval()` for safely evaluating strings containing expressions from untrusted sources.


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
eval('os.listdir(".")')
```

Example of **secure** code:

```python
ast.literal_eval('os.listdir(".")')
```
