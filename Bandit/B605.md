Pattern: Starting a process with a shell

Issue: -

## Description

This rule looks for the spawning of a subprocess using a command shell. This type of subprocess
invocation is dangerous as it is vulnerable to various shell injection attacks. Great care should be taken to sanitize all input in order to mitigate
this risk. Calls of this type are identified by the use of certain commands which are known to use shells.


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
import os

os.system('/bin/echo suspicious code')
```

The `subprocess` module provides more powerful facilities for spawning new processes and retrieving their results; using that module is preferable to using this function.


Example of **secure** code:

```python
import subprocess

subprocess.call('/bin/echo suspicious code', shell=False)
```
