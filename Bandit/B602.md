Pattern: Use of `subprocess` with `shell=True`

Issue: -

## Description

This rule looks for the spawning of a `subprocess` using a command shell. This type of `subprocess`
invocation is dangerous as it is vulnerable to various shell injection
attacks. Great care should be taken to sanitize all input in order to mitigate
this risk. Calls of this type are identified by a parameter of `shell=True`
being given.

Additionally, this rule scans the command string given and adjusts its
reported severity based on how it is presented. If the command string is a
simple static string containing no special shell characters, then the
resulting issue has low severity. If the string is static, but contains shell
formatting characters or wildcards, then the reported issue is medium.
Finally, if the string is computed using Python's string manipulation or
formatting operations, then the reported issue has high severity. These
severity levels reflect the likelihood that the code is vulnerable to
injection.


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
import subprocess

subprocess.Popen(['/bin/gcc', '--version'], shell=True)
```

Example of **secure** code:

```python
import subprocess

subprocess.Popen(['/bin/gcc', '--version'], shell=False)
```
