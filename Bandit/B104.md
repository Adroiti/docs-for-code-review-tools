Pattern: Possible binding to all interfaces

Issue: -

## Description

Binding to all network interfaces can potentially open up a service to traffic
on unintended interfaces, that may not be properly documented or secured. This
rule looks for a string pattern `0.0.0.0` that may indicate a hardcoded
binding to all network interfaces.


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
s.bind(('0.0.0.0', 8080))
```

Example of **secure** code:

```python
s.bind(('192.168.0.1', 8080))
```
