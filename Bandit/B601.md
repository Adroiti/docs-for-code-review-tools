Pattern: Possible shell injection via `Paramiko` call

Issue: -

## Description

This rule checks the use of `Paramiko`'s `exec_command` or `invoke_shell` methods advising the user to check if inputs are
correctly sanitized.

`Paramiko` is a Python library designed to work with the `SSH2` protocol for
secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines. It is
intended to run commands on a remote host. These commands are run within a
shell on the target and are thus vulnerable to various shell injection
attacks.


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
import paramiko

paramiko.exec_command('something; really; unsafe')
```

Example of **secure** code:

```python
import paramiko

paramiko.connect('somehost')
```
