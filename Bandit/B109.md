Pattern: `oslo` config option not marked `secret=True`

Issue: -

## Description

Passwords are sensitive and must be protected appropriately. In OpenStack Oslo
there is an option to mark options "secret" which will ensure that they are
not logged. This plugin detects usages of `oslo` configuration functions that
appear to deal with strings ending in `password` and flag usages where they
have not been marked secret.


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
cfg.StrOpt('admin_password', help="User's password")
```

Example of **secure** code:
