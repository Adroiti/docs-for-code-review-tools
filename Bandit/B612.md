Pattern: Unsafe use of `logging.config.listen`

Issue: -

## Description

The `logging.config.listen` function provides the ability to listen for external configuration files on a socket server. Because portions of the configuration are passed through `eval()`, use of this function may open its users to a security risk.

While the function only binds to a socket on localhost, and so does not accept connections from remote machines, there are scenarios where untrusted code could be run under the account of the process which calls `listen()`.
