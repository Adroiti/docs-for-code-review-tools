Pattern: Possible wildcard injection

Issue: -

## Description

Python provides a number of methods that emulate the behavior of standard
Linux command line utilities. Like their Linux counterparts, these commands
may take a wildcard `*` character in place of a file system path. This is
interpreted to mean "any and all files or folders" and can be used to build
partially qualified paths, such as `/home/user/*`.

The use of partially qualified paths may result in unintended consequences if
an unexpected file or symlink is placed into the path location given. This
becomes particularly dangerous when combined with commands used to manipulate
file permissions or copy data off of a system.

This rule looks for usage of the following commands in conjunction with wild card parameters:

  - `chown`
  - `chmod`
  - `tar`
  - `rsync`

As well as any method configured in the shell or subprocess injection test configurations.


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
import os as o
import subprocess as subp

o.popen2('/bin/chmod *')
```

Example of **secure** code:

```python
import os as o
import subprocess as subp

subp.Popen(['/bin/chown', '*'])
```
