Pattern: Starting a process with a partial path

Issue: -

## Description

This rule scans the parameters of all configured Python methods, looking
for paths that do not start at the file-system root, that is, do not have a
leading `/` character.

Python possesses many mechanisms to invoke an external executable. If the
desired executable path is not fully qualified relative to the file-system root
then this may present a potential security risk.

In POSIX environments, the PATH environment variable is used to specify a set
of standard locations that will be searched for the first matching named
executable. While convenient, this behavior may allow a malicious actor to
exert control over a system. If they are able to adjust the contents of the
PATH variable, or manipulate the file system, then a bogus executable may be
discovered in place of the desired one. This executable will be invoked with
the user privileges of the Python process that spawned it, potentially a
highly privileged user.


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen as pop

pop('gcc --version', shell=False)
```

Example of **secure** code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen as pop

pop('/bin/gcc --version', shell=False)
```
