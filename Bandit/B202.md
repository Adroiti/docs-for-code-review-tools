Pattern: Use of `tarfile.extractall()`

Issue: -

## Description

Severity are set as follows:

    `tarfile.extractalll(members=function(tarfile))` - LOW
    `tarfile.extractalll(members=?)` - member is not a function - MEDIUM
    `tarfile.extractall()` - members from the archive is trusted - HIGH

Use `tarfile.extractall(members=function_name)` and define a function that will inspect each member. Discard files that contain a directory traversal sequences such as ../ or \.. along with all special filetypes unless you explicitly need them.
