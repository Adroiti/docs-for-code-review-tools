Pattern: Insecure usage of temporary file/directory

Issue: -

## Description

Safely creating a temporary file or directory means following a number of
rules (see the references for more details). This rule looks for
strings starting with (configurable) commonly used temporary paths, for
example:

- `/tmp`
- `/var/tmp`
- `/dev/shm`
- `etc`


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
f = open('/tmp/abc', 'w')
f.write('def')
f.close()
```

Example of **secure** code:

```python
f = open('/abc/tmp', 'w')
f.write('def')
f.close()
```
