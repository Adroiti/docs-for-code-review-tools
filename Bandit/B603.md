Pattern: Use of `subprocess` with `shell=False`

Issue: -

## Description

This rule looks for the spawning of a `subprocess` without the use of a command shell. This type of
`subprocess` invocation is not vulnerable to shell injection attacks, but care should still be taken to ensure validity of input.
