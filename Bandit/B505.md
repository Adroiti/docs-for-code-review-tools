Pattern: Use of weak cryptographic key

Issue: -

## Description

As computational power increases, so does the ability to break ciphers with
smaller key lengths. The recommended key length size for `RSA` and `DSA`
algorithms is `2048` and higher. `1024` bits and below are now considered
breakable. `EC` key length sizes are recommended to be `224` and higher with `160`
and below considered breakable. This rule checks for use of any key
less than those limits.


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
from cryptography.hazmat import backends
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import dsa

dsa.generate_private_key(key_size=1024, backend=backends.default_backend())
```

Example of **secure** code:

```python
from cryptography.hazmat import backends
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import dsa

dsa.generate_private_key(key_size=2048, backend=backends.default_backend())
```
