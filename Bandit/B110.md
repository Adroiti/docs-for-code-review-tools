Pattern: A `pass` in the `except` block

Issue: -

## Description

This pattern is considered bad practice in general, but also represents a
potential security issue. A larger than normal volume of errors from a service
can indicate an attempt is being made to disrupt or interfere with it. Thus
errors should, at the very least, be logged.

There are rare situations where it is desirable to suppress errors, but this
is typically done with specific exception types, rather than the base
Exception class (or no type).


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
try:
  do_some_stuff()
except Exception:
  pass
```
  
Example of **secure** code:

```python
try:
  do_some_stuff()
except ZeroDivisionError:
  pass
```
