Pattern: Use of insecure SSL/TLS protocol version

Issue: -

## Description

Several highly publicized exploitable flaws have been discovered in all
versions of SSL and early versions of TLS. It is strongly recommended that use
of the following known broken protocol versions be avoided:

  - SSL v2
  - SSL v3
  - TLS v1
  - TLS v1.1

This rule scans for calls to Python methods with parameters that
indicate the used broken SSL/TLS protocol versions. Currently, detection
supports methods using Python's native SSL/TLS support and the `pyOpenSSL`
module.

It is worth noting that native support for TLS 1.2 is only available in more
recent Python versions, specifically 2.7.9 and up, and 3.x.


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv2)
```

Example of **secure** code:

```python
context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23)
context.options |= ssl.OP_NO_SSLv2
context.options |= ssl.OP_NO_SSLv3
```

When using SSLv23 it is important to also provide flags to explicitly exclude bad versions of SSL/TLS from the protocol versions considered. Both the Python native and `pyOpenSSL` modules provide the `OP_NO_SSLv2` and `OP_NO_SSLv3` flags for this purpose.
