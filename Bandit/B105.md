Pattern: Use of hard-coded password strings

Issue: -

## Description

The use of hard-coded passwords increases the possibility of password guessing
tremendously. This rule looks for all string literals and checks the
following conditions:

  - assigned to a variable that looks like a password
  - assigned to a dict key that looks like a password
  - used in a comparison with a variable that looks like a password

Variables are considered to look like a password if they have match any one
of:

  - `password`
  - `pass`
  - `passwd`
  - `pwd`
  - `secret`
  - `token`
  - `secrete`

Note: this can be noisy and may generate false positives.


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
if password == "root":
	print("OK, logged in")
```
