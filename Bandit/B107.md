Pattern: Use of hard-coded password argument defaults

Issue: -

## Description

The use of hard-coded passwords increases the possibility of password guessing
tremendously. This rule looks for all function definitions that specify
a default string literal for some argument. It checks that the argument does
not look like a password.

Variables are considered to look like a password if they have match any one
of:

  - `password`
  - `pass`
  - `passwd`
  - `pwd`
  - `secret`
  - `token`
  - `secrete`
  
Note: this can be noisy and may generate false positives.


Example of **insecure** code:

```python
def someFunction(user, password="Admin"):
    print("Hi " + user)
```
