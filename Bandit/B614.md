Pattern: Unsafe use of PyTorch

Issue: -

## Description

Using `torch.load` with untrusted data can lead to arbitrary code execution, and improper use of `torch.save` might expose sensitive data or lead to data corruption. 

A safe alternative is to use `torch.load` with the `safetensors` library from hugingface, which provides a safe deserialization mechanism.
