Pattern: Use of `pycryptodome`

Issue: -

## Description

`pycryptodome` is a direct fork of `pycrypto` that has not fully addressed the inherent issues. It seems to exist, mainly, as an API compatible continuation of `pycrypto` and should be deprecated in favor of `pyca/cryptography` which has more support among the Python community.
