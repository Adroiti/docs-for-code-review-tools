Pattern: Use of possibly insecure `HTTPSConnection`

Issue: -

## Description

Use of `HTTPSConnection` on older versions of Python prior to `2.7.9` and `3.4.3` does not provide security. The `Requests` package is recommended for a higher-level HTTP client interface.

This rule checks for the following calls:

  - `httplib.HTTPSConnection`
  - `http.client.HTTPSConnection`
  - `six.moves.http_client.HTTPSConnection`
