Pattern: Use of Django's `mark_safe()`

Issue: -

## Description

Use of Django's `mark_safe()` may expose cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and should be reviewed.

It is also important to be particularly careful when using `is_safe()` with custom template tags, the `safe()` template tag, `mark_safe()`, and when autoescape is turned off.
