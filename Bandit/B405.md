Pattern: Import of `xml.etree.ElementTree` module

Issue: -

## Description

Using various methods to parse untrusted XML data is known to be vulnerable to
XML attacks. Replace vulnerable imports with the equivalent `defusedxml`
package, or make sure `defusedxml.defuse_stdlib()` is called.

This rule checks for the following imports:

  - `xml.etree.cElementTree`
  - `xml.etree.ElementTree`
