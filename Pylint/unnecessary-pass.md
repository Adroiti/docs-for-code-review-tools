Pattern: Unnecessary `pass` statement

Issue: -

## Description

A `pass` statement is only necessary when it is the only statement in a block. If the block already contains other statements then the `pass` statement is unnecessary and can be removed.


Example of **incorrect** code:

```python
try:
    A = 1
except ValueError:
    A = 2
    pass # [unnecessary-pass]
```

Example of **correct** code:

```python
try:
    A = 1
except ValueError:
    pass
```
