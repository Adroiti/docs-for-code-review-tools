Pattern: Multiple statements in one line

Issue: -

## Description

Python syntax does permit more than one statement on a line, separated by semicolon (`;`). However, limiting each line to one statement makes it easier for a human to follow a program's logic when reading through it.


Compound statements are also discouraged by _PEP 8_ style guide.


Example of **incorrect** code:

```python
if foo == 'bar': init()
do_one(); do_two(); do_three()
```

Example of **correct** code:

```python
if foo == 'bar':
    init()
do_one()
do_two()
do_three()
```
