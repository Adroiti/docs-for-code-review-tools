Pattern: Mixed indentation

Issue: -

## Description

Python interprets tabs and spaces differently, so consistent indentation is critical to the correct interpretation of blocks in Python syntax.


This warning is raised when a mix of both spaces and tabs is used in indentation or more precisely, when an indent is detected that is not consistent with the Pylint's `indent-string` option. By default, `indent-string` is set to four spaces.


Example of **incorrect** code:
```python
def tab_func():
    # Using tabs (non-default) for indentation
  """hi""" # [mixed-indentation]
  print("hi") # [mixed-indentation]
```

Example of **correct** code:
```python
def spaces_func():
    # Using 4 spaces (default) for indentation
    """hi"""
    print("hi")
```
