Pattern: Trailing whitespace

Issue: -

## Description

This rule enforces _PEP 8_ recommendation to avoid trailing whitespace anywhere. Because it's usually invisible, it can be confusing: e.g. a backslash followed by a space and a newline does not count as a line continuation marker. Some editors don't preserve it and many projects (like _CPython_ itself) have pre-commit hooks that reject it.


Example of **incorrect** code:
```python
print('some trailing whitespace after this statement')   
```

Example of **correct** code:
```python
print('no trailing whitespace')
```
