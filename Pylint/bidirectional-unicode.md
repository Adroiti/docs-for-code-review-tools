Pattern: Use of bidirectional text

Issue: -

## Description

Bidirectional unicode typically does not show characters required to display right-to-left (RTL) script (i.e. Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hebrew, ...) correctly.

If you did not write it or your language is not RTL, remove the special characters, as they could be used to trick you into executing code, that does something else than what it looks like.
