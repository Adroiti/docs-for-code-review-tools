Pattern: Bad `mcs` classmethod argument

Issue: -

## Description

Used when a metaclass class method has a first argument named differently than the value specified in `valid-metaclass-classmethod-first-arg` option (default to `mcs`), recommended to easily differentiate them from regular instance methods.
