Pattern: Missing indentation for closing bracket

Issue: -

## Description

A closing bracket is missing indentation. This error only occurs if the `--hang-closing` flag is used, switching the default behavior of closing brackets so that they require hanging indents.

### Example of **incorrect** code:

**Note:** This is not an anti-pattern by default. This only occurs if the `--hang-closing` flag is used.

```python
my_list = [
    1, 2, 3,
    4, 5, 6,
]
```

### Example of **correct** code:

```python
my_list = [
    1, 2, 3,
    4, 5, 6,
    ]
```
