Pattern: Missing use of `is not` for object identity test

Issue: -

## Description

Tests for object identity should use the form `x is not None` rather than `not x is None`. The former example is more readable.

### Example of **incorrect** code:

```python
if not user is None:
    print(user.name)
```

### Example of **correct** code:

```python
if user is not None:
    print(user.name)
```
