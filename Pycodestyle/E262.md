Pattern: Missing whitespace for inline comment

Issue: -

## Description

Inline comments should have one space before the pound sign (`#`) and the comment itself.

### Example of **incorrect** code:

```python
def print_name(self):
    print(self.name)  #This comment needs a space
```

### Example of **correct** code:


```python
def print_name(self):
    print(self.name)  # Comment is correct now
```
