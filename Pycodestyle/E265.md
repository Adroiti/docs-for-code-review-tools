Pattern: Missing whitespace for block comment

Issue: -

## Description

Block comments should have one space before the pound sign (`#`) and the comment itself.

### Example of **incorrect** code:

```python
#This comment needs a space
def print_name(self):
    print(self.name)
```

### Example of **correct** code:

```python
# Comment is correct now
def print_name(self):
    print(self.name)
```
