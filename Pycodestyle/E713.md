Pattern: Missing use of `not in` for membership test

Issue: -

## Description

Tests for membership should use the form `x not in the_list` rather than `not x in the_list`. The former example is more readable.

### Example of **incorrect** code:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
if not num in my_list:
    print(num)
```

### Example of **correct** code:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
if num not in my_list:
    print(num)
```
