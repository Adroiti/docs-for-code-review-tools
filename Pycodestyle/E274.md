Pattern: Use of tab before keyword

Issue: -

## Description

There should be only one space before a keyword.

### Example of **incorrect** code:

In this example there is a tab before the `in` keyword.

**Note:** The `→` character represents a tab.

```python
def func():
    if 1→in [1, 2, 3]:
        print('yep!')
```

### Example of **correct** code:

Use only one space before the `in` operator.

```python
def func():
    if 1 in [1, 2, 3]:
        print('yep!')
```
