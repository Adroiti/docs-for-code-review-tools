Pattern: Use of over-indented code

Issue: -

## Description

Code should have consistent indentation, typically spaced out in increments of two or four.

### Example of **incorrect** code:

The `print` function on the following line is indented at five spaces instead of four.

```python
if True:
     print('Hi there')
```

### Example of **correct** code:

The code is now spaced out at four spaces instead of five.

```python
if True:
    print('Hi there')
```
