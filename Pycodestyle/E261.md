Pattern: Use of one space before inline comment

Issue: -

## Description

Inline comments should have two spaces before them. Often programmers will only include one space, which will trigger this warning.

### Example of **incorrect** code:

```python
def print_name(self):
    print(self.name) # This comment needs an extra space
```

### Example of **correct** code:


```python
def print_name(self):
    print(self.name)  # Comment is correct now
```
