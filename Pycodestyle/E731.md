Pattern: Assigning lambda to variable

Issue: -

## Description

Lambdas should not be assigned to a variable. Instead, they should be defined as functions.

The primary reason for this is debugging. Lambdas show as `<lambda>` in tracebacks, where functions will display the function's name.

### Example of **incorrect** code:

```python
root = lambda folder_name: os.path.join(BASE_DIR, folder_name)
```

### Example of **correct** code:

```python
def root(folder_name):
    return os.path.join(BASE_DIR, folder_name)
```
