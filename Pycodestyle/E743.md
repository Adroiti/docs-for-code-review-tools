Pattern: Use of poorly named function

Issue: -

## Description

Functions named `I`, `O`, and `l` can be very hard to read. This is because the letter `I` and the letter `l` are easily confused, and the letter `O` and the number `0` can be easily confused.

Change the names of these functions to something more descriptive.
