Pattern: Use of equality comparison for singleton object

Issue: -

## Description

Comparisons to the singleton objects, like `True`, `False`, and `None`, should be done with identity, not equality. Use `is` or `is not`.

### Example of **incorrect** code:

```python
if var != True:
    print("var is not equal to True")
if var == None:
    print("var is equal to None")
```

### Example of **correct** code:

```python
if var is not True
    print("var is not True")
if var is None
    print("var is None")
   
```
