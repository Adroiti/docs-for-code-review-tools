Pattern: Over-indented continuation line for visual indent

Issue: -

## Description

A continuation line is indented farther than it should be for a visual indent.

### Example of **incorrect** code:

In this example, the string `"World"` is indented two spaces farther than it should be.

```python
print("Python", ("Hello",
                   "World"))
```

### Example of **correct** code:

```python
print("Python", ("Hello",
                 "World"))
```
