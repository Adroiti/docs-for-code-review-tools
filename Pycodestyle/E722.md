Pattern: Use of bare except

Issue: -

## Description

When catching exceptions, mention specific exceptions whenever possible instead of using a bare `except:` clause.

A bare `except:` clause will catch `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt` exceptions, making it harder to interrupt a program with Control-C, and can disguise other problems. If you want to catch all exceptions that signal program errors, use `except Exception:` (bare except is equivalent to except BaseException:).

### Example of **incorrect** code:

The following code has a bare `except:` clause.

```python
try:
    user = User.objects.get(pk=user_id)
    user.send_mail('Hello world')
except:
    logger.error('An error occurred!')
```

### Example of **correct** code:

Instead, catch specific exceptions whenever possible.

```python
try:
    user = User.objects.get(pk=user_id)
    user.send_mail('Hello world')
except User.DoesNotExist:
    logger.error('The user does not exist with that ID')
```
