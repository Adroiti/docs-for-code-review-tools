Pattern: Visually indented line with same indent as next logical line

Issue: -

## Description

A visual indented line has the same indentation as the next logical line. This can make it hard to read.

### Example of **incorrect** code:

In this example the second line is indented at the same level as the body of the `if` statement.

```python
if (row < 0 or module_count <= row or
    col < 0 or module_count <= col):
    raise Exception("%s,%s - %s" % (row, col, self.moduleCount))
```

### Example of **correct** code:

```python
if (row < 0 or module_count <= row or
        col < 0 or module_count <= col):
    raise Exception("%s,%s - %s" % (row, col, self.moduleCount))
```
