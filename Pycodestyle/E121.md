Pattern: Use of under-indented continuation line for hanging indent

Issue: -

## Description

A line is less indented than it should be for hanging indents.

### Example of **incorrect** code:

In the first example, the keys of this `dict` are only indented with 3 spaces. They should be indented with 4 spaces.

```python
result = {
   'key1': 'value',
   'key2': 'value',
}
```

### Example of **correct** code:

```python
result = {
    'key1': 'value',
    'key2': 'value',
}
```

### Example of **incorrect** code:

In this example, the second line is only indented with 2 spaces. It should be indented with 4 spaces.

```python
print("Python", (
  "Rules"))
```

### Example of **correct** code:

```python
print("Python", (
    "Rules"))
```
