Pattern: Undocumented public class

Issue: -

## Description

Reports public classes, objects and interfaces which do not have the required documentation. Enable this rule if the codebase should have documentation on every public class, interface and object.

By default this rule also searches for nested and inner classes and objects. This default behavior can be changed with the configuration options of this rule.
