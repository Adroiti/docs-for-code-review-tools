Pattern: Missing use of `run {}`

Issue: -

## Description

Chains of safe calls on non-nullable types are redundant and can be removed by enclosing the redundant safe calls in a `run {}` block. This improves code coverage and reduces cyclomatic complexity as redundant null checks are removed.

This rule only checks from the end of a chain and works backwards, so it won’t recommend inserting run blocks in the middle of a safe call chain as that is likely to make the code more difficult to understand.

The rule will check for every opportunity to replace a safe call when it sits at the end of a chain, even if there’s only one, as that will still improve code coverage and reduce cyclomatic complexity.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```kotlin
val x = System.getenv()
    ?.getValue("HOME")
    ?.toLowerCase()
    ?.split("/") ?: emptyList()
```

Example of **correct** code:

```kotlin
val x = getenv()?.run {
    getValue("HOME")
        .toLowerCase()
        .split("/")
} ?: emptyList()
```
