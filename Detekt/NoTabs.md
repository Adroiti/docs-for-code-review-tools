Pattern: Use of tab character

Issue: -

## Description

This rule reports if tabs are used in Kotlin files. According to [Google's Kotlin style guide](https://android.github.io/kotlin-guides/style.html#whitespace-characters) the only whitespace chars that are allowed in a source file are the line terminator sequence and the ASCII horizontal space character (`0x20`). Strings containing tabs are allowed.
