Pattern: Invalid range

Issue: -

## Description

Reports ranges which are empty. This might be a bug if it is used for instance as a loop condition. This loop will never be triggered.
This might be due to invalid ranges like `(10..9)` which will cause the loop to never be entered.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```kotlin
for (i in 2..1) {}
for (i in 1 downTo 2) {}

val range = 2 until 1
```
