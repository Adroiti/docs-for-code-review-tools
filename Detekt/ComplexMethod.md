Pattern: Complex method

Issue: -

## Description

Complex methods are hard to understand and read. It might not be obvious what side-effects a complex method has.
Prefer splitting up complex methods into smaller methods that are in turn easier to understand.
Smaller methods can also be named much clearer which leads to improved readability of the code.
