Pattern: Redundant modifier

Issue: -

## Description

Checks for redundant modifiers in: 

  1. Interface and annotation definitions.
  2. Final modifier on methods of final and anonymous classes.
  3. Inner `interface` declarations that are declared as `static`. 
  4. Class constructors.
  5. Nested `enum` definitions that are declared as `static`. 

Rationale: The Java Language Specification strongly discourages the usage of `public` and `abstract` for method declarations in interface definitions as a matter of style. 

Interfaces by definition are abstract so the `abstract` modifier on the interface is redundant. 

Classes inside of interfaces by definition are public and static, so the `public` and `static` modifiers on the inner classes are redundant. On the other hand, classes inside of interfaces can be abstract or non abstract. So, `abstract` modifier is allowed. 

Fields in interfaces and annotations are automatically public, static and final, so these modifiers are redundant as well. 

As annotations are a form of interface, their fields are also automatically public, static and final just as their annotation fields are automatically public and abstract. 

Enums by definition are static implicit subclasses of `java.lang.Enum<E>`. So, the `static` modifier on the enums is redundant. In addition, if enum is inside of interface, `public` modifier is also redundant. 

Enums can also contain abstract methods and methods which can be overridden by the declared enumeration fields. See the following example: 
    
    
              public enum EnumClass {
                 FIELD_1,
                 FIELD_2 {
                     @Override
                     public final void method1() {} // violation expected
                 };
    
                 public void method1() {}
                 public final void method2() {} // no violation expected
              }
            

Since these methods can be overridden in these situations, the final methods are not marked as redundant even though they can't be extended by other classes/enums. 

Nested `enum` types are always static by default. 

Final classes by definition cannot be extended so the `final` modifier on the method of a final class is redundant. 

Public modifier for constructors in non-public non-protected classes is always obsolete: 
    
    
              public class PublicClass {
                public PublicClass() {} // OK
              }
    
              class PackagePrivateClass {
                public PackagePrivateClass() {} // violation expected
              }
            

There is no violation in the following example, because removing public modifier from ProtectedInnerClass constructor will make this code not compiling: 
    
    
              package a;
              public class ClassExample {
                protected class ProtectedInnerClass {
                  public ProtectedInnerClass () {}
                }
              }
    
              package b;
              import a.ClassExample;
              public class ClassExtending extends ClassExample {
                ProtectedInnerClass pc = new ProtectedInnerClass();
              }
            

## Examples

To configure the check: 
    
    
    <module name="RedundantModifier"/>
            

To configure the check to check only methods and not variables: 
    
    
    <module name="RedundantModifier">
      <property name="tokens" value="METHOD_DEF"/>
    </module>
