Pattern: Repeated unquoted spaces between words in `echo`

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found multiple unquoted spaces between words passed to `echo`. Due to the way arguments are interpreted and passed in the shell, these will collapse into a single space:

```
$ echo Hello        World
Hello World
```

If you want to output multiple spaces, such as when creating a notice or banner, make sure the spaces are quoted, e.g. by adding (or extending) double quotes to include them:

```
$ echo "Hello        World"
Hello        World
```

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
'''
echo Hello        World
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
echo "Hello        World"
```
