Pattern: Possible loss of precision in _Bash_ integer division

Issue: -

## Description

If integer division is performed before multiplication, the intermediate result will be truncated causing a loss of precision.

In this case, if  `count=1` and `total=2`, then the problematic code results in `percent=0`, while the correct code gives `percent=50`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
percent=$((count/total*100))
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
percent=$((count*100/total))
```

## Exceptions

If you want and expect truncation you can ignore this message.

ShellCheck doesn't warn when `b` and `c` are identical expressions, e.g. `a/10*10`, under the assumption that the intent is to rounded to the nearest 10 rather than the no-op of multiply by `1`.
