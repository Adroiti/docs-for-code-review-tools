Pattern: Use of process substitution

Issue: -

## Description

Process substitution is a ksh and bash extension. It does not work in sh or dash scripts.

The easiest fix is to switch to a shell that does support process substitution, by changing the shebang to `#!/bin/bash` or `ksh`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
while IFS= read -r n
do
  sum=$((sum+n))
done < <(program)
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
while IFS= read -r n
do
  sum=$((sum+n))
done < <(program)
```

Alternatively, process substitution can often be replaced with temporary files:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
tmp="$(mktemp)"
program > "$tmp"
while IFS= read -r n
do
  sum=$((sum+n))
done < "$tmp"
rm "$tmp"
```
