Pattern: Use of undefined `$'..'`

Issue: -

## Description

You are using the interpolated string Bashism `$'..'` in a script that declares itself as POSIX sh (e.g. via `#!/bin/sh`).

To ensure the script runs correctly on other systems, either switch to Bash, or rewrite it in a POSIX compatible way.

This can generally done via `printf` as in the example. Be careful about strings with trailing linefeeds, as a `$(command substitution)` will strip them.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
IFS=$' \t\n'
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# Note: \n can not be last, or it will be stripped by $()
IFS=$(printf ' \n\t')
```
