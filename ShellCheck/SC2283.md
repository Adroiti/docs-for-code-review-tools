Pattern: Missing use of `[]` to compare values

Issue: -

## Description

If this was supposed to be a comparison, use square brackets: `[ "$var" = value ]`

If this was supposed to be an assignment, remove spaces around `=`: `var=value`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
# Assignment
var = value

# Comparison
if $var = value
then
  echo "Match"
fi
```

fi
