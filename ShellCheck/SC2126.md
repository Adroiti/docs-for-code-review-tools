Pattern: Use of `grep|wc` instead of `grep -c`

Issue: -

## Description

`grep` can count lines without piping to `wc`.

Note that in many cases, this number is only used to see whether there are matches (i.e. `== 0`). In these cases, it's better and more efficient to use `grep -q` and check its exit status:

```sh
if grep -q pattern file
then
  echo "The file contains the pattern"
fi
```

Also note that in `foo | grep bar | wc -l`, wc will mask the exit code of grep by default (i.e. without `set -o pipefail`), and always return success. If replacing with `foo | grep -c bar`, grep will exit non-zero when the count is 0. This is convenient for conditional statements but may require handling when used with `set -e`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
grep foo | wc -l
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
grep -c foo
```

## Exceptions

If you e.g. want to count characters instead of lines, and you actually care about the number and not just whether it's greater than 0, you can ignore this error.
