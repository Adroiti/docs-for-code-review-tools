Pattern: Use of nested parameter expansion

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found what appears to be a nested parameter expansion. In the example, it was hoping to combine `${var##*/}` to strip the directory and `${var%.*}` to strip the extension.

Parameter expansions can't be nested. Use temporary variables instead, so that each parameter expansion only does a single operation.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
path="/path/to/MyFile.mp3"
echo "Playing ${${path##*/}%.*}"    # Expect: Playing MyFile
```

The extra `$` was unintentional and should simply be deleted.

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
path="/path/to/MyFile.mp3"
tmp=${path##*/}
echo "Playing ${tmp%.*}"
```
