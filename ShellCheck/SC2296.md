Pattern: Parameter expansion starts with `{`

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found a parameter expansion `${something}` that starts with an invalid character. In the example, this was caused by accidentally duplicating the `{` in `${{name}`.

Double check the syntax of what you're trying to do.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo "Hello ${{name}"
