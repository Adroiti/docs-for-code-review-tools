Pattern: `$?` refers to a condition

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found a `$?` that always refers to a condition like `[ .. ]`, `[[ .. ]]`, or `test`.

This most commonly happens when trying to inspect `$?` before doing something with it, such as inspecting it again or exiting with it, without realizing that any such inspection will also overwrite `$?`.

In the first problematic example, `[ $? -ne 14 ]` will never be true because it only runs after `[ $? -ne 0 ]` has modified $? to be 0. The solution is to assign `$?` from `mycommand` to a variable so that the variable can be inspected repeatedly.

In the second problematic example, `exit $?` will always `exit 0`, because it only runs if `[ $? -gt 0 ]` returns success and sets `$?` to 0. The solution could again be to assign `$?` to a variable first, or (as shown) use `mycommand || exit $?` as there is no condition to overwrite `$?`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
mycommand
if [ $? -ne 0 ] && [ $? -ne 14 ]
then
  echo "Command failed"
fi
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
mycommand
ret=$?
if [ $ret -ne 0 ] && [ $ret -ne 14 ]
then
  echo "Command failed"
fi
```
