Pattern: Use of string as argument to numerical operator

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found a string used as an argument to a numerical operator like `-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt`, `-ge`. Such strings will be treated as arithmetic expressions, meaning `n` will refer to a variable `$n`, and `24/12` will be evaluated into `2`. 

In the problematic example, the intention was instead to compare `"n"` as a string, so it should use the equivalent string operator instead, in this case `=`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
read -p "Continue? [y/n] " var
[ "$var" -eq "n" ​] && exit 1
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
#read -p "Continue? [y/n] " var
[ "$var" = "n" ​] && exit 1
```
