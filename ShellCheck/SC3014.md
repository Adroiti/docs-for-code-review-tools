Pattern: Use of undefined `==` in place of `=`

Issue: -

## Description

`==` is used for equality comparison in C-like languages, and is also supported by `bash` and `ksh` in `[ .. ]` and `test` expressions.

`sh` and `dash` only supports `=` for equality comparison, so use that instead.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
if [ $1 == "-n" ]
then
  dry_run=1
fi
```
