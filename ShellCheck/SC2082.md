Pattern: Malformed variable expansion via indirection

Issue: -

## Description

You can expand a variable `var_1` with `${var_1}`, but you can not generate the string `var_1` with an embedded expansion, like `${var_$n}`.

Instead, if at all possible, you should use an array. Bash and ksh support both numerical and associative arrays.

If you can't use arrays, you can indirectly reference variables by creating a temporary variable with its name, e.g. `myvar="var_$n"` and then expanding it indirectly with `${!myvar}`. This will give the contents of the variable `var_1`.

If using POSIX sh, where neither arrays nor `${!var}` is available, `eval` can be used. You must be careful in sanitizing the data used to construct the variable name to avoid arbitrary code execution.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
var_1="hello world"
n=1
echo "${var_$n}"
```

Example of **correct** code:

Bash/ksh:

```sh
# Use arrays instead of dynamic names
declare -a var
var[1]="hello world"
n=1
echo "${var[n]}"
```

or

```sh
# Expand variable names dynamically
var_1="hello world"
n=1
name="var_$n"
echo "${!name}"
```

POSIX sh:

```sh
# Expand dynamically with eval
var_1="hello world"
n=1
eval "tmp=\$var_$n"
echo "${tmp}"
```
