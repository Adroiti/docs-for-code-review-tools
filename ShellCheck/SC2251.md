Pattern: Ineffectual `!` in front of command

Issue: -

## Description

Command inverted with `!` may have no effect. In particular, it does not appear as a condition in an `if` statement or `while` loop, or as the final command in a script or function.

The most common reason for this is thinking that it'll trigger `set -e` aka `errexit` if a command succeeds, as in the example. This is not the case: `!` will inhibit errexit both on success and failure of the inverted command.

Using `&& exit ` will instead exit when failure when the command succeeds.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
set -e
! false
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
set -e
! false && exit 1
```

## Exceptions

ShellCheck will not detect cases where `$?` is implicitly or explicitly used to check the value afterwards:

```
set -e;
check_success() { [ $? -eq 0 ] || exit 1; }
! false; check_success
! true; check_success
```

In this case, you can ignore the warning.
