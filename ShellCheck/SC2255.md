Pattern: Use of `[[ .. ]]` with numerical comparator

Issue: -

## Description

When using `[[ .. ]]` with numerical comparators (`-eq`, `-lt`, etc), the value on either side will be evaluated as an arithmetic expression. This means that `2*3` will be evaluated to `6`, and `x` will be evaluated to the contents of the variable `$x`.

When using `[ .. ]`, this does not happen. `2*3` and `x` will both be considered invalid numbers. Instead, use e.g. `$((2*3))` to evaluate the expression before passing it to `[ .. ]`.

Alternatively, if the expression should be considered a string, quote the expression and use a string comparison operator like `=` and `!=`. 

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
[ 2*3 -eq array[i] ]
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
[ $((2*3)) -eq $((array[i])) ]
```
