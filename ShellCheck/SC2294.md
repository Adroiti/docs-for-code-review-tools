Pattern: Use of `eval` on an array

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found `eval` used on an array (or equivalently, `"$@"`). This is problematic because it effectively throws away all boundary information and rebuilds it from shell words.

Let's say you invoke `check sed -i '$d' "my file.txt"`:

`eval "$@"` will:
1. Join the elements on spaces: `sed -i $d my file.txt`
2. Split the string on shell word boundaries: `sed`, `-i`, `$d`, `my` `file.txt`
3. Perform shell expansions (assuming `$d` is unset): `sed`, `-i`, `my`, `file.txt`
4. Execute the first element as the command and the rest as its arguments, as if running `sed -i 'my' 'file.txt'`

`"$@"` will
1. Execute the first element as the command and the rest as its arguments, as if running `sed -i '$d' 'my file.txt'`

Note that while `"$@"` is essentially always better than `eval "$@"`, it's easy to unintentionally introduce a dependency on bad behavior through the shell debugging anti-strategy of "adding quotes until it works":

```
# Works with problematic example because of double-escaping, fails with correct example
check ls -l "'My File.txt'" 

# Works with correct example the way it was always intended:
check ls -l "My File.txt" 
```

The correct example is still better, but the function invocation has to be tweaked as well.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
check() {
  eval "$@" || exit
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
check() {
  "$@" || exit
}
```
