Pattern: Looping over single, constant value

Issue: -

## Description

This rule checks for loops that iterate over a single, constant value. This is most likely a bug in your code, caused not expanding the value in the way you want.

You should make sure that whatever you loop over will expand into multiple words.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
for var in value
do
  echo "$var"
done
```

Example of **correct** code:

Correct code depends on what you want to do.

To iterate over files in a directory, instead of `for var in /my/dir` use:

```sh
for var in /my/dir/* ; do echo "$var"; done
```

To iterate over lines in a file or command output, use a while read loop instead:

```sh
mycommand | while IFS= read -r line; do echo "$line"; done
```

To iterate over *words* written to a command or function's stdout, instead of `for var in myfunction`, use

```sh
for var in $(myfunction); do echo "$var"; done
```

To iterate over *words* in a variable, instead of  `for var in myvariable`, use

```sh
for var in $myvariable; do echo "$var"; done
```
