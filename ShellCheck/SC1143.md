Pattern: Use of comment for backslash line continuation

Issue: -

## Description

Backslash line continuations are not respected in comments, and the line instead simply terminates. This is a problem when commenting out one line in a multi-line command like the example.

Instead, either move the line away from its statement, or use an `` `# inline comment` `` in an unquoted backtick command substitution. 

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
sed \
  -e "s/HOST/$HOSTNAME/g"   \
# -e "s/USER/$USER/g"       \
  -e "s/ARCH/$(uname -m)/g" \
  "$buildfile"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
sed \
  -e "s/HOST/$HOSTNAME/g"   \
  -e "s/ARCH/$(uname -m)/g" \
  "$buildfile"

# This comment is moved out:
# -e "s/USER/$USER/g"       \
```
