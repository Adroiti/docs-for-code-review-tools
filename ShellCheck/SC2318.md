Pattern: Ineffective assignment in `declare`

Issue: -

## Description

When assigning variables via a command, such as `declare`, `typeset`, `local` etc, the expansion of all arguments happen before all assignments. This means that you can't have a variable assigned and then referenced in the same command.

In the example, if `$1` is 42, the arguments will first be expanded in the current environment into `-i first=42 current=`. They will then be passed to `declare` which will perform the assignments.

To correctly set `current=$first` so that it uses the new value of `first`, use two separate commands as shown.

Note that this only applies when assigning via commands, because arguments are always expanded before commands are invoked. If assigning without a command, as in `first=$1 current=$first`, it will work as expected.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
declare -i first=$1 current=$first
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
declare -i first=$1
declare -i current=$first
```
