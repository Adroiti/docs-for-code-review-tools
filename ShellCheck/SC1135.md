Pattern: Use of `"` to make `$` literal

Issue: -

## Description

The script appears to be closing a double quoted string for the sole purpose of making a dollar sign `$` literal.

While this happens to work, the better solution is instead to escape it with a backslash. This allows the double quoted string to continue uninterrupted, thereby reducing the visual noise of stopping and starting quotes in the middle of a shell word.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo "The apples are $""1 each"
eval "var=$"name
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
echo "The apples are \$1 each"
eval "var=\$name"
# or better yet: var="${!name}"
```
