Pattern: Use of `$"(` or `$"{`

Issue: -

## Description

This is most likely due to flipping the dollar-sign and double quote:

    echo $"(cmd)"  # Supposed to be "$(cmd)"
    echo $"{var}"  # Supposed to be "${var}"

Instead of quoted substitutions, these will be interpreted as localized string resources (`$".."`) containing literal parentheses or curly braces. If this was not intentional, you should flip the `"` and `$` like in the example.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
var=$"(whoami)"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
var="$(whoami)"
```

## Exceptions:

If you intentionally wanted a localized string literal `$".."` that starts with `(` or `{`, either ignore this error or start it with a different character.
