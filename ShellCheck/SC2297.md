Pattern: Use of double qoutes in `${}`

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found a parameter expansion containing what appears to be a quoted variable name. While the parameter expansion itself must be quoted, as in `"${valid}"`, the quotes may not appear inside the `{}` as in `${"invalid"}`.

Also note that translated strings like `$"Hello"` may not use curly braces.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo ${"USER"}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
echo "${USER}"
```
