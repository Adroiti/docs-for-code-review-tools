Pattern: Declaration modifier used as command name

Issue: -

## Description

In most languages, declaration modifiers like `public`/`static`/`const` are keywords and you can apply multiple to any declaration.

In shell scripting they are instead command names, and anything after them is an argument. This means that `readonly local foo` will create two readonly variables: `local`, and `foo`. Neither will be local.

Instead, either use multiple commands, or use a single `declare` command with appropriate flags (`declare` will automatically make a variable local when invoked in a function, unless `-g` is passed to explicitly make it global).

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
local readonly foo=3
readonly export bar=4
```

Example of **correct** code:
