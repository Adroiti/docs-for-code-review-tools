Pattern: Unreachable command

Issue: -

## Description

The problematic code wanted to exit with success if the user explicitly asked for `--help`. However, since the `usage` function already had an `exit 1`, this statement could never run.

One possible solution is to change `usage()` to only echo, and let callers be responsible for exiting.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
usage() {
  echo >&2 "Usage: $0 -i input"
  exit 1
}     
if [ "$1" = "--help" ]
then
  usage
  exit 0   # Unreachable
fi
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
usage() {
  echo >&2 "Usage: $0 -i input"
}     
if [ "$1" = "--help" ]
then
  usage
  exit 0
fi
```
