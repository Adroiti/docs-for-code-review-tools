Pattern: Command name ends with a symbol

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found a command name ending with a symbol, such as a comma, parenthesis, quote, or similar. This is almost always due to a syntax issue in the script.

In the examples, bad quoting and invalid array syntax caused the shell to try to run commands ending in apostrophe, curly brace, and comma, respectively.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
var=$("wget 'http://www.shellcheck.net/'")
echo Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}
array=val1, val2, val3
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
var="$(wget 'http://www.shellcheck.net/')"
echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}"
array=(val1 val2 val3)
```
