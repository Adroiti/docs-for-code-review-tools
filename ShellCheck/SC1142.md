Pattern: Missing use of `done < <(cmd)`

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found a `done` keyword followed by a process substitution, e.g. `done <(cmd)`.

The intention was most likely to redirect from this process substitution, in which case you will need one extra `<`: `done < <(cmd)`.

This is because `<(cmd)` expands to a filename (e.g. `/dev/fd/63`), and you need a `<` to redirect from filenames.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
sum=0
while IFS="" read -r n
do
  (( sum += n ))
done <(file) 
```
