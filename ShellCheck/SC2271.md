Pattern: Use of `var$n=value`

Issue: -

## Description

`var$n=value` is not a valid way of assigning to a dynamically created variable name in any shell. Please use one of the other methods to assign to names via expanded strings.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
n=1
var$n="hello"
```

Example of **correct** code:

For integer indexing in ksh/bash, consider using an indexed array:

```sh
n=1
var[n]="hello"
echo "${var[n]}"
```

For string indexing in ksh/bash, use an associative array:

```sh
typeset -A var
n="greeting"
var[$n]="hello"
echo "${var[$n]}"
```

If you actually need a variable with the constructed name in bash, use `declare`:

```sh
n="Foo"
declare "var$n=42"
echo "$varFoo"
```

For `sh`, with single line contents, consider `read`:
```sh
n="Foo"
read -r "var$n" << EOF
hello
EOF
echo "$varFoo"
```
