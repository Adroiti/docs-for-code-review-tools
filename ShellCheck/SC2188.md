Pattern: Use of redirection that doesn't redirect from/to anything

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found a redirection that doesn't actually redirect from/to anything.

This could indicate a bug, such as in the problematic code where an additional linefeed causes `report.txt` to be truncated instead of containing report output, or in `foo & > bar`, where either `foo &> bar` or `foo > bar &` was intended. 

However, it could also be intentionally used to truncate a file or check that it's readable. You can make this more explicit for both ShellCheck and human readers by using `true` or `:` as a dummy command, e.g. `true > file` or `: > file`. 
 
Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
{ 
  echo "Report for $(date +%F)"
  uptime
  df -h
}
> report.txt
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
{ 
  echo "Report for $(date +%F)"
  uptime
  df -h
} > report.txt
```
## Exceptions

There are no semantic problems with using `> foo` over `true > foo`, so if you don't see this as a potential source of bugs or confusion, you can ignore it.
