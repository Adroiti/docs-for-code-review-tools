Pattern: Use of `expr` with `:` to match a regex

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found an `expr` command using `:` to match a regex, but the regex is not quoted and therefore being treated as a glob.

This means that if the problematic code is ever executed in a directory containing a file matching `[0-9]*`, such as `2021-reports` or `12 Angry Men [1957].mkv`, it will be replaced be replaced and cause the command to error or incorrectly match.

The regex should be quoted to avoid this, like in the correct example.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
expr "$input" : [0-9]*
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
expr "$input" : "[0-9]*"
```
