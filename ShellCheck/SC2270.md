Pattern: Missing use of `set -- first second ..`

Issue: -

## Description

You have a command on the form `$2=value`.

If the goal is to assign a new value to the positional parameters, use the `set` builtin: `set -- one two ..` will cause `$1` to be "one" and `$2` to be "two".

If you instead want to compare the value, use `[ ]` and add spaces: `[ "$1" = "foo" ]`  

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if [ -z "$1" ]
then
  $1="help"
fi
```
