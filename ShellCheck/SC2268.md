Pattern: Use of x-prefix in comparison

Issue: -

## Description

Some older shells would get confused if the first argument started with a dash, or consisted of `!` or `(`. As a workaround, people would prefix variables and values to be compared with `x` to ensure the left-hand side always started with an alphanumeric character.

POSIX ensures this is not necessary, and all modern shells now follow suite.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
[ "x$pass" = "xswordfish" ]

test x"$var" = x 
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
[ "$pass" = "swordfish" ] 

test "$var" = ""
```
