Pattern: Use of empty string as command name

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found an empty string used as a command name. This is never valid. 

If the command is intended to do nothing, use `true` aka `:` instead. Otherwise, determine why an empty string ended up as a command name and fix it accordingly. In the example, each line was interpreted as a separate command due to missing line continuations. 

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
jq 
   ''
   file.json

```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
jq \
  '' \
  file.json

```
