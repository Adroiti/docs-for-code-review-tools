Pattern: Translated string is the name of variable

Issue: -

## Description

`$".."` is a localized string, for example, `echo $"Hello $USER"` along with the proper translation files can be used to have the script say "Bonjour, youruser" in French locales.

In this case, ShellCheck found a localized string whose contents is also the name of a variable. This could have happened because the user wanted a far more common quoted substitution, e.g. `"$var"`, but accidentally switched the leading `$` and `"`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
var="foo"
echo $"var"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
var="foo"
echo "$var"
```
