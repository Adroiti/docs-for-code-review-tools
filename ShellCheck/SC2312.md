Pattern: Masking command return value

Issue: -

## Description

If the command shows `error: Can't determine chroot` and exits with failure without outputting a directory, then the command being run will be `cd "/etc"` and the script will proceed to overwrite the host system's configuration.

By assigning it to a variable first, the exit code of the command will propagate into the exit code of the assignment, so that it can be checked explicitly with `if` or implicitly with `set -e`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
set -e
cd "$(get_chroot_dir)/etc"
tar xf "${config}"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
set -e
dir="$(get_chroot_dir)"
cd "${dir}/etc"
tar xf "${config}"
```
