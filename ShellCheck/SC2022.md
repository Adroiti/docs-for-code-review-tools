Pattern: Possible regular expression misuse in shell script

Issue: -

## Description

As a glob, `foo*` means "Any string starting with foo", e.g. `food` and `foosball`.

As a regular expression, "foo*" means "f followed by 1 or more o's, anywhere", e.g. "mofo" or "keyfob".

This construct is way more common as a glob than as a regex, so ShellCheck notifies you about it.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
grep 'foo*'
```

when wanting to match `food` and `foosball`, but not `mofo` or `keyfob`.

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
grep '^foo'
```

## Exceptions

If you're aware of the above, you can ignore this message. If you'd like shellcheck to be quiet, use a directive or `'fo[o]*'`.
