Pattern: Shebang indicating a directory

Issue: -

## Description

The shebang specifies which file to use as an interpreter, but probably due to some kind of typo, your script's interpreter ends in a `/`, indicating a directory.

Ensure it points to a valid executable filename.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh/
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
