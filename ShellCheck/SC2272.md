Issue: -

## Description

Most likely, this was intended as a kind of comparison. To compare two values, use `[ value1 = value2 ]`. Both the brackets and the spaces around the `=` are relevant. 

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
$a/$b==foo/bar
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
[ "$a/$b" = "foo/bar" ] 
```
