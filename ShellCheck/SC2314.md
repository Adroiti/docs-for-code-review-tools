Pattern: Test never fails

Issue: -

## Description

Bats uses `set -e` and `trap ERR` to catch test failures as early as possible.
Although the return code of a `!` negated command is inverted, they will never trigger `errexit`, due to a bash design decision.
This means that tests which use `!` can never fail.

Starting with bats 1.5.0 you can use `!` inside `run`.
If you are still using an older bats version, you can rewrite `! <command>` to `<command> && exit 1`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bats

@test "test" {
    # ... code
    ! test_file_exists
    # ... more code
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bats

@test "test" {
    # ... code
    run ! test_file_exists
    # ... more code
}
```
