Pattern: Use of `case` with invalid flag

Issue: -

## Description

Invalid flags are not handled. Add a `*)` case.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
while getopts "vr" f
do
  case "$f" in
    v) echo "verbose" ;;
    r) echo "recursive" ;;
  esac
done
```

The `case` statement handling `getopts` arguments does not have a default branch to handle unknown flags.

When a flag is not recognized, such as if passing `-Z` to the example code, `getopts` will set the variable to a literal question mark `?`. This should be handled along with all the valid flags, usually by printing a usage message and exiting with failure.

Using a `\?)` or `?)` case will also match invalid flags, but`*)` would additionally match things like the empty string if the variable name was misspelled.

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
while getopts "vr" f
do
  case "$f" in
    v) echo "verbose" ;;
    r) echo "recursive" ;;
    *) echo "usage: $0 [-v] [-r]" >&2
       exit 1 ;;
  esac
done
```

## Exceptions

If your script's logic handles unrecognized flags in another way, e.g. after the `case` statement, you can ignore this warning.
