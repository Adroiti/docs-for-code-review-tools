Pattern: Missing default case

Issue: -

## Description

Found `case` statement may not be considering all possible cases. This may mean that only the [happy paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path) are accounted for. Consider adding a default case to handle other values. If you don't know what to do or don't believe it'll ever happen, exiting with an error is good, fail-fast practice.

The example is adapted from a real world Debian init script, which due to a missing default case reports success on any misspelled command (here with underscore instead of dash):

```
$ /etc/init.d/screen-cleanup force_reload && echo success
success
```

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
case "$1" in
  start) start_service ;;
  stop)  stop_service ;;
  restart|reload|force-reload)
    stop_service;
    start_service;;
esac
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
case "$1" in
  start) start_service ;;
  stop)  stop_service ;;
  restart|reload|force-reload)
    stop_service;
    start_service;;
  *)
    echo >&2 "Invalid choice: $1"
    exit 1
esac
```
