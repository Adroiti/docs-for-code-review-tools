Pattern: Missing space in shell script

Issue: -

## Description

Bourne shells are whitespace sensitive. Adding or removing spaces can drastically alter the meaning of a script.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if ![-z foo ]; then true; fi # if command `[-z' w/ args `foo', `]' fails..
```
Example of **correct** code:

```sh
if ! [ -z foo ]; then true; fi # if command `[' w/ args `-z', `foo', `]' fails..
```

## Exceptions

ShellCheck does not understand Bash History Expansion, an interactive shell feature also using `!` (such as `!!` to expand to the previous command). 

These features are disabled by default in shells and very rarely used in scripts, but may occasionally be found in interactively sourced files like `.bashrc`. Please ignore the error in these cases.
