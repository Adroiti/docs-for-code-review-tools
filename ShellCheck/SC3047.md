Pattern: Trapping `ERR` is undefined

Issue: -

## Description

You are trying to install a trap that is not supported by your current shell (`dash` or POSIX `sh`). There is no simple replacement. The script should be rewritten to avoid depending on the trap, or simply be run with a shell that supports it.

Also applies to `RETURN` and `DEBUG`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
trap 'Command failed with $?' ERR
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
trap 'Command failed with $?' ERR
```
