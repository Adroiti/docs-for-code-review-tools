Pattern: Redirecting to command that does not read from stdin

Issue: -

## Description

You are redirecting to one of several commands that don't read from stdin.

This may happen when:

* Confusing one command for another, e.g. using `echo` where `cat` was intended.
* Incorrectly quoting angle brackets, e.g. using `echo <p>Hello` which tries to read from a file `p`.
* Missing `xargs`, e.g. `mv -t dir < files` instead of `xargs mv -t dir < files` (or more safely, `tr '\n' '\0' < files | xargs -0 mv -t dir`), because stdin should be passed as parameters.

Check your logic, and rewrite the command so data is passed correctly.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
echo << eof
  Hello World
eof
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
cat << eof
  Hello World
eof
```

## Exceptions

If you've overridden a command to return output, you can either rename it to make this obvious, or ignore this message.
