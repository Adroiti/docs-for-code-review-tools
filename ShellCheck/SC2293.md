Pattern: Use of `eval` with escaped array

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck noticed that you are calling `eval` and including an escaped array. However, the array is passed as multiple arguments and relies on being implicitly joined together to form a single shell string, which `eval` can then evaluate.

Instead, prefer building your shell string with explicit string concatenation by using `*` instead of `@` for the index, such as `${*@Q}` or `${array[*]@Q}`.

This suggestion is equivalent to `SC2124`, but for `eval` arguments rather than string variables.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
eval "$MYCOMMAND ${@@Q}"
```
