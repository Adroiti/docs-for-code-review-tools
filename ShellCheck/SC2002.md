Pattern: Unnecessary use of `cat`

Issue: -

## Description

`cat` is a tool for con"cat"enating files. Reading a single file as input to a program is considered a [Useless Use Of Cat (UUOC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)#Useless_use_of_cat).

It's more efficient and less roundabout to simply use redirection. This is especially true for programs that can benefit from seek-able input, like `tail` or `tar`.

Many tools also accept optional filenames, e.g. `grep -q foo file` instead of `cat file | grep -q foo`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
cat file | tr ' ' _ | nl
cat file | while IFS= read -r i; do echo "${i%?}"; done
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
< file tr ' ' _ | nl  
while IFS= read -r i; do echo "${i%?}"; done < file
```

## Exceptions

Pointing out UUOC is a long standing shell programming tradition, and removing them from a short-lived pipeline in a loop can speed it up by 2x. However, it's not necessarily a good use of time in practice, and rarely affects correctness. Ignore as you see fit.
