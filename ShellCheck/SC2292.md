Pattern: Use of `[ ]` for test in Bash/Ksh

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck has been explicitly asked to warn about uses of `[ .. ]` in favor of the extended Bash/Ksh test `[[ .. ]]`.

`[[ .. ]]` suppresses word splitting and globbing, supports a wider variety of tests, and is generally safer and better defined than `[ .. ]`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
[ -e /etc/issue ] 
```

Example of **correct** code:
