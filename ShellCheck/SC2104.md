Pattern: Use of `break`/`continue` to exit a function

Issue: -

## Description

`break` or `continue` are used to abort or continue a loop, and are not the right way to exit a function. Use `return` instead.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
foo() {
  if [[ -z $1 ]]
  then
    break
  fi
  echo "Hello $1"
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
foo() {
  if [[ -z $1 ]]
  then
    return 1
  fi
  echo "Hello $1"
}
```
## Exceptions

The `break` or `continue` may be intended for a loop that calls the function:

```
# Rarely valid
foo() { break; echo $?; }
while true; do foo; done
```

This is undefined behavior in POSIX sh. Different shells do different things.

When the function is called from a loop:

* `ksh` keeps going and `$?` is 0.
* `bash` version 4.4+ prints an error "break: only meaningful in a \`for', \`while', or \`until' loop", the function keeps going, and `$?` is 0. 
* `bash` versions before 4.4, will return from the function, break the loop calling the function, or exit a subshell if there's one in between.
* `dash`, BusyBox `ash`: like above.

When the function is not called from a loop:

* All `bash` versions print an error "break: only meaningful in a \`for', \`while', or \`until' loop", the function keeps going, and `$?` is 0. 
* `ksh`, `dash` and `ash` silently keep going and `$?` is 0.

Due to the many different implementations, many of which are not helpful, it's recommended to use proper flow control. A typical solution is making sure the function `return`s success/failure, and calling `myfunction || break` in the loop.
