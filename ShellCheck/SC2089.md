Pattern: Literal use of quote or backslash

Issue: -

## Description

Bash does not interpret data as code. Consider almost any other languages, such as Python:

```sh
print 1+1   # prints 2
a="1+1"
print a     # prints 1+1, not 2
```

Here, `1+1` is Python syntax for adding numbers. However, passing a literal string containing this expression does not cause Python to interpret it, see the `+` and produce the calculated result.

Similarly, `"My File.txt"` is Bash syntax for a single word with a space in it. However, passing a literal string containing this expression does not cause Bash to interpret it, see the quotes and produce the tokenized result.

The solution is to use an array instead, whenever possible.

If due to `sh` compatibility you can't use arrays, you can use `eval` instead. However, this is very insecure and easy to get wrong, leading to various forms of security vulnerabilities and breakage:

```sh
quote() { local q=${1//\'/\'\\\'\'}; echo "'$q'"; }
args="-lh $(quote "My File.txt")"
eval ls "$args" # Do not use unless you understand implications
```

If you ever accidentally forget to use proper quotes, such as with:

```sh
for f in *.txt; do
  args="-lh '$1'" # Example security exploit
  eval ls "$args" # Do not copy and use
done
```

Then you can use `touch "'; rm -rf \$'\x2F'; '.txt"`  (or someone can trick you into downloading a file with this name, or create a zip file or git repo containing it, or changing their nick and have your chat client create the file for a chat log, or...), and running the script to list your files will run the command `rm -rf /`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
args='-lh "My File.txt"'
ls $args
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
args=(-lh "My File.txt")
ls "${args[@]}"
```
