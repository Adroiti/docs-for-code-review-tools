Pattern: Use of function as condition with `set -e`

Issue: -

## Description

Function is used as a condition in a script where `set -e` is enabled. This means that the function will run without `set -e`, and will power through any errors.

This applies to `if`, `while`, and `until` statements, commands negated with `!`, as well as the left-hand side of `||` and `&&`. It does not matter how deeply the command is nested in such a structure.

In the problematic example, the intent was that an error like `cp: error writing '/backup/important.txt': No space left on device` would cause the script to abort. Instead, since the function is invoked in an `if` statement, the script will proceed to delete all the files even though it failed to back them up.

The fix is to call it outside of an `if` statement. There is no point in checking whether the command succeeded, since the script would abort if it didn't. You may also want to consider replacing `set -e` with explicit `|| exit` after every relevant command to avoid such surprises.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
#shellcheck enable=check-set-e-suppressed

set -e

backup() {
  cp *.txt /backup
  rm *.txt            # Runs even if copy fails!
}

if backup
then
    echo "Backup successful"
fi
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
#shellcheck enable=check-set-e-suppressed

set -e

backup() {
  cp *.txt /backup
  rm *.txt
}

backup
echo "Backup successful"
```
