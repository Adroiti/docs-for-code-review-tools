Pattern: Unexpected parameter after condition

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found characters (other than redirections) after the `]` or `]]` in a test expression. This is not valid.

This sometimes happens when there was an additional expression or command, but joining `||` or `&&` is missing. Alternatively, it could happen due to typos (like `[[ $1 ]]]` with an extra `]`), or generally from malformed test expressions.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
[ "$1" ] input="$1"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
[ "$1" ] && input="$1"
```
