Pattern: Constant test result due to literal string

Issue: -

## Description

Since `[ str ]` checks that the string is non-empty, the space inside the quotes in the problematic code causes the test to always be true, since a string with a space can not be empty.

Sometimes this is also caused by over-quoting an example, e.g. `[ "$foo -gt 0" ]`, which is always true for the same reason. The intention here was `[ "$foo" -gt 0 ]`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
if [ "$foo " ]
then
  echo "this is always true"
fi
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
if [ "$foo" ]
then
  echo "correctly checks value"
fi
```
