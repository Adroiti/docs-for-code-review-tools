Pattern: Use of unusual symbol in command name

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found a command name containing an especially unusual character like a tab or linefeed. This is most likely due to a syntax issue.

In the example, this was due to a Python style documentation string, which a shell will merely interpreted as a multi-line command name sandwiched between two empty strings.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
'''
This script greets the planet
'''
echo "Hello World"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
# This script greets the planet
echo "Hello World"
```
