Pattern: Use of unquoted variable in case branch pattern

Issue: -

## Description

When unquoted variables and command expansions are used in case branch patterns, they will be interpreted as globs. 

This can lead to some surprising behavior, such as `case $x in $x) trigger;; esac` not triggering in some cases, such as when `x='Pride and Prejudice [1813].epub'`.

To match the literal content of the variable or expansion, make sure to double quote the expansion.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
case $input in
  -       ) echo "Reading from stdin..." ;;
  $output ) echo "Input should be different from output" ;;
esac
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
case $input in
  -         ) echo "Reading from stdin..." ;;
  "$output" ) echo "Input should be different from output" ;;
esac
```
