Pattern: Use of `for` loop over array values

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found a `for` loop over array *values*, where the variable is used as an array *key*. 

In the problematic example, the loop will print `Value is foo` twice. On the second iteration, `i=bar`, and `bar` is unset and considered zero, so `${array[$i]}` becomes `${array[bar]}` becomes `${array[0]}` becomes `foo`.

If you don't care about the key, simply loop over array values and use `$i` to refer to the array value, like in the first correct example.

If you do want the key, loop over array keys with `"${!array[@]}"`, use `$i` to refer to the array key, and `${array[$i]}` to refer to the array value.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
array=(foo bar)
for i in "${array[@]}"
do
  echo "Value is ${array[$i]}"
done
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
for i in "${array[@]}"
do
  echo "Value is $i"
done

```
