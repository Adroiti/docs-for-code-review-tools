Pattern: Use of space around `=`

Issue: -

## Description

Parameters to `export`, `declare`, `local`, `typeset` and `readonly` may not have spaces around the `=` or `+=` operator. This is the same as for regular variable assignments:

    export var = value   # Invalid: spaces around =
    export var =value    # Invalid: space before =
    export var= value    # Invalid: space after =
    export var=value     # Valid

This is because each individual argument to these commands is interpreted as a string in the format `name=value`. By adding spaces, you are instead passing the three strings `var`, `=`, `value`, none of which follow this format.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
export LC_ALL = "POSIX"
```
