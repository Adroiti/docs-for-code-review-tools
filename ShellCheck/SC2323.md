Pattern: Use of extra parentheses

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found an entire arithmetic expression wrapped in parentheses. This does not serve a purpose since the expression is already clearly delimited by the construct it's in, such as `array[..]=` or `$((..))` in the example.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
array[(x+1)]=val
echo $(( (x+1) ))
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
array[x+1]=val
echo $((x+1))
```
