Pattern: Command name ends with `/`

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found a command name that ends with `/`. Since directories are not valid commands, this is always wrong.

The most common reason is bad quoting or escaping, such as in the example where a space was missing between a command and its argument.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
df/
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
df /
```
