Pattern: Use of undefined `declare` command

Issue: -

## Description

The `declare` command is non-standard, and most of its functionality is not available across shells.

Either find a POSIX replacement, or switch to a shell that is guaranteed to support them.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
declare var="value"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
var="value"
