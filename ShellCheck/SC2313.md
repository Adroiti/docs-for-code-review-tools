Pattern: Use of `read` with unquoted `[]`

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found an array element passed to read, where the `[]` was not quoted. This means the array index `[index]` will be treated as a glob range, and the word may be replaced or trigger `failglob`.  

In the problematic example, having a directory named `food` will cause the command to become `read -r food` instead, since `food` matches the glob `foo[index]`. The result is assigning a value to the wrong variable.

Quote or escape the pattern as shown to ensure it always reads into the array `foo` at index `index`. 

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
read -r foo[index]
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
read -r "foo[index]"
```
