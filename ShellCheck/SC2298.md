Pattern: Use of invalid `${$x}`

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found a parameter expansion `${..}` where the first element was a second parameter expansion, either `${$x..}` or `${${x}..}`. This is not valid.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
# Expecting $RETRIES or 3 if unset
retries=${$RETRIES:-3}
```

The extra `$` was unintentional and should simply be deleted.

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
retries=${RETRIES:-3}
```
