Pattern: Use of `expr` with insufficient number of args

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found an `expr` command with 1 or 2 arguments. `expr` normally expects 3 or more.

Generally, this happens for one of two reasons:

* You are using an operator like `|`, `&`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, which needs to be escaped to avoid the shell interpreting it as a pipe, backgrounded command, or redirection.
* You don't have spaces around operators and operands (or have bad quotes) which causes them not to be separate arguments.

Make sure each operator or operand to `expr` is a separate argument, and that anything containing shell metacharacters is escaped. The correct code shows examples of each.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
# | not escaped
expr 1 | 2
# > not escaped
expr "$foo" >= "$bar"

# Missing spaces around +
expr 1+2
# Unexpected quoting around an expression
expr "1 + 2"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
expr 16 \| 7
expr "$foo" \>= "$bar"
expr 1 + 2
```
