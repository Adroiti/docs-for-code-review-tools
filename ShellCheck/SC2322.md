Pattern: Use of doubly nested parentheses

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found doubly nested parentheses in an arithmetic expression. While the syntax for an arithmetic expansion is `$((..))`, this does not imply that parentheses in the expression should also be doubled. `(x)`, `((x))`, and `(((x)))` are all identical, so you might as well use only one layer of parentheses.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
value=$(( ((offset + index)) * 512 )) 
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
value=$(( (offset + index) * 512 ))
```
