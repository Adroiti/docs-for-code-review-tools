Pattern: Use of `'..'` to run as a command

Issue: -

## Description

The intent was to run the code in the single quotes. This would have worked with slanted backticks, `` `..` ``, but here the very similar looking single quotes `'..'` were used, resulting in a string literal instead of command output.

This is one of the many problems with backticks, so it's better to use `$(..)` to expand commands.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
for i in 'seq 1 10'
do
  echo "$i"
done
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
for i in $(seq 1 10)
do
  echo "$i"
done
```
