Pattern: `$?` refers to `echo`/`printf`

Issue: -

## Description

ShellCheck found a `$?` that always refers to `echo` or `printf`. 

This most commonly happens when trying to show `$?` before doing something with it, without realizing that any such action will also overwrite `$?`.

In the problematic example, `echo "Command exited with $?"` was intended to show the exit code before acting on it, but the act of showing `$?` also overwrote it, so the condition is always false. The solution is to assign `$?` to a variable first, so that it can be used repeatedly.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
mycommand
echo "Command exited with $?"
if [ $? -ne 0 ]
then
  echo "Failed"
fi
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
mycommand
ret=$?
echo "Command exited with $ret"
if [ $ret -ne 0 ]
then
  echo "Failed"
fi
```
