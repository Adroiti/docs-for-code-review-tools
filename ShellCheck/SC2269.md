Pattern: Variable is assigned to itself

Issue: -

## Description

Variable is assigned to itself, e.g. x=$x. This obviously has no effect.

Double check what the assignment was supposed to do.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
var="$var"
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
# If the goal is to do nothing
true
```
