Pattern: Use of `-r` in `chmod`

Issue: -

## Description

Many tools use `-r` for recursive operation, but in `chmod` this removes read permissions.

If you wanted to change permissions recursively, change the flag to `-R`. If you wanted to remove read permissions, consider using `a-r` explicitly to make this more obvious.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
chmod -r 0700 dir
chmod -r file
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
chmod -R 0700 dir
chmod a-r file
```
