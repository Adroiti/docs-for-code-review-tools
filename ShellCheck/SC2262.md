Pattern: Use of alias with definition

Issue: -

## Description

Alias expansion happens at parse time, which means to have an effect, the `alias` command must be executed not just before the alias is invoked, but before the invocation is parsed. 

A shell will parse commands until it has a complete set of commands followed by a linefeed. This includes compound commands like `{ brace; groups; }` and `while loops; do true; done`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
function checksum() {
  type md5 && alias md5sum=md5
  md5sum "$@"  # This calls `md5sum`, not `md5`
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```sh
function checksum() {
  type md5 && md5sum() { md5sum "$@"; }
  md5sum "$@"  # Now this would call `md5` when applicable
}
```
