Pattern: Unsorted objects

Issue: -

## Description

Enforce sorted objects.

By adhering to this rule, developers can ensure that object keys are consistently sorted, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code. This rule promotes a standardized key ordering across objects, making it easier to navigate and understand the structure of objects within the codebase.

Itâ€™s safe. The rule considers spread elements in objects and does not break component functionality.
