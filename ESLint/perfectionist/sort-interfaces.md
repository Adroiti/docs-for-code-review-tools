Pattern: Unsorted interface properties

Issue: -

## Description

Enforce sorted TypeScript interface properties.

Sorting interface properties in TypeScript provides a clear and predictable structure to the codebase. This rule helps developers locate various properties defined within an interface more easily, promoting consistency and enabling efficient maintenance and collaboration.

Additionally, it ensures that property comments are sorted along with the properties themselves, preserving documentation clarity.
