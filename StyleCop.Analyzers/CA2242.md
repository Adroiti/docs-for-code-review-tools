Pattern: Malformed test for NaN

Issue: -

## Description

`System.Double.NaN`, which represents a value that's not a number, results when an arithmetic operation is undefined. Any expression that tests for equality between a value and `System.Double.NaN` always returns `false`. Any expression that tests for inequality (`!=` in C#) between a value and `System.Double.NaN` always returns `true`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```cs
Console.WriteLine(0 / zero == double.NaN);
```

Example of **correct** code:

```cs
Console.WriteLine(double.IsNaN(0 / zero));
```
