Pattern: Semicolons must be spaced correctly

Issue: Invalid spacing around the semicolon

## Description

A violation of this rule occurs when the spacing around a semicolon is incorrect.

A semicolon should always be followed by a single space, except in the following cases:

* The semicolon is the last character on the line
* The semicolon followed by a closing parenthesis

A semicolon should never be preceded by any whitespace, unless it is the first character on the line.

## How to fix

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure that the semicolon is followed by a single space, and is not preceded by any space.
