Pattern: Missing use of `ObjectDisposedException`

Issue: -

## Description

Object checks have a substantial impact on code size and often dominate the code for small functions and property setters. These checks prevent inlining and cause substantial instruction-cache pollution. Throw-helper methods such as `ThrowIf` are simpler and more efficient than `if` blocks that construct a new exception instance.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```cs
class TestClass
{
    private bool _disposed = false;
    void TestMethod()
    {
        if (_disposed)
            throw new ObjectDisposedException(GetType().Name);
    }
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```cs
class TestClass
{
    private bool _disposed = false;
    void TestMethod()
    {
        ObjectDisposedException.ThrowIf(_disposed, this);
    }
}
```
