Pattern: Inexact read with `Stream.Read`

Issue: -

## Description

`Stream.Read` and `Stream.ReadAsync` might return fewer bytes than requested, resulting in unreliable code if the return value isn't checked.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```cs
void Test(Stream stream, byte[] buffer)
{
    stream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```cs
void Test(Stream stream, byte[] buffer)
{
    stream.ReadExactly(buffer);
}
```
