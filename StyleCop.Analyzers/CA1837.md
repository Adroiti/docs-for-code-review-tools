Pattern: Use of `Process.GetCurrentProcess().Id`

Issue: -

## Description

`System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess().Id` is expensive:

- It allocates a `Process` instance, usually just to get the `Id`.
- The `Process` instance needs to be disposed, which has a performance impact.
- It's easy to forget to call `Dispose()` on the `Process` instance.
- If nothing else besides `Id` uses the `Process` instance, then the linked size grows unnecessarily by increasing the graph of types referenced.
- It is somewhat difficult to discover or find this API.

`System.Environment.ProcessId` avoids all the above.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```cs
int pid = Process.GetCurrentProcess().Id;
```

Example of **correct** code:

```cs
int pid = System.Environment.ProcessId;
```
