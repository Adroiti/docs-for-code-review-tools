Pattern: Missing use of `ContainsKey()`/`ContainsValue()`

Issue: -

## Description

Calling `Contains` on the `Keys` or Values collection can often be more expensive than calling `ContainsKey` or `ContainsValue` on the dictionary itself:

- Many dictionary implementations lazily instantiate the key and value collections, which means that accessing the `Keys` or `Values` collection may result in extra allocations.
- You may end up calling an extension method on `IEnumerable<T>` if the keys or values collection uses explicit interface implementation to hide methods on `ICollection<T>`. This can lead to reduced performance, especially when accessing the key collection. Most dictionary implementations are able to provide a fast O(1) containment check for keys, while the `Contains` extension method on `IEnumerable<T>` usually does a slow O(n) containment check.


Example of **incorrect** code:

```cs
var dictionary = new Dictionary<string, int>();
dictionary.Values.Contains(17);
```

Example of **correct** code:

```cs
var dictionary = new Dictionary<string, int>();
dictionary.ContainsValue(17);
```
