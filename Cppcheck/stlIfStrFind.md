Pattern: Misuse of `string::find()`

Issue: -

## Description

Either inefficient or wrong usage of `string::find()`. `string::compare()` will be faster if `string::find` result is compared with 0, because it will not scan the whole string. If your intention is to check that there are no findings in the string, you should compare with `std::string::npos`.
