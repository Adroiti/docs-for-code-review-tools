Pattern: Use of incompatible command in targeted _PowerShell_ platform

Issue: -

## Description

This rule identifies commands that are not available on a targeted PowerShell platform.

A PowerShell platform is identified by a name in the following format:

```
<os-name>_<os-arch>_<os-version>_<ps-version>_<ps-arch>_<dotnet-version>_<dotnet-edition>
```

Where:

- `<os-name>`: The name of the operating system PowerShell is running on.
    On Windows, this includes the SKU number.
    On Linux, this is the name of the distribution.
- `<os-arch>`: The machine architecture the operating system is running on (this is usually `x64`).
- `<os-version>`: The self-reported version of the operating system (on Linux, this is the distribution version).
- `<ps-version>`: The PowerShell version (from `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`).
- `<ps-arch>`: The machine architecture of the PowerShell process.
- `<dotnet-version>`: The reported version of the .NET runtime PowerShell is running on (from `System.Environment.Version`).
- `<dotnet-edition>`: The .NET runtime flavor PowerShell is running on (currently `framework` or `core`).

For example:

- `win-4_x64_10.0.18312.0_5.1.18312.1000_x64_4.0.30319.42000_framework` is PowerShell 5.1 running on Windows 10 Enterprise (build 18312) for x64.
- `win-4_x64_10.0.18312.0_6.1.2_x64_4.0.30319.42000_core` is PowerShell 6.1.2 running on the same operating system.
- `ubuntu_x64_18.04_6.2.0_x64_4.0.30319.42000_core` is PowerShell 6.2.0 running on Ubuntu 18.04.

Some platforms come bundled with PSScriptAnalyzer as JSON files, named in this way for targeting in your configuration.

The compatibility analysis compares a command used to both a target profile
and a "union" profile (containing all commands available in *any* profile in the profile dir).
If a command is not present in the union profile, it is assumed to be locally created and ignored.
Otherwise, if a command is present in the union profile but not present in a target,
it is deemed to be incompatible with that target.

## Configuration settings

An example configuration might look like:

```PowerShell
@{
    Rules = @{
        PSUseCompatibleCommmands = @{
            Enable = $true
            TargetProfiles = @(
                'ubuntu_x64_18.04_6.1.3_x64_4.0.30319.42000_core'
                'win-48_x64_10.0.17763.0_5.1.17763.316_x64_4.0.30319.42000_framework'
                'MyProfile'
                'another_custom_profile_in_the_profiles_directory.json'
                'D:\My Profiles\profile1.json'
            )
            # You can specify commands to not check like this, which also will ignore its parameters:
            IgnoreCommands = @(
                'Install-Module'
            )
        }
    }
}
```
