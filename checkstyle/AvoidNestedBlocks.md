Pattern: Use of nested block

Issue: -

## Description

Finds nested blocks, i.e. blocks that are used freely in the code. 

Rationale: Nested blocks are often leftovers from the debugging process, they confuse the reader. 

For example this check finds the obsolete braces in 


```java
public void guessTheOutput()
{
    int whichIsWhich = 0;
    {
        int whichIsWhich = 2;
    }
    System.out.println("value = " + whichIsWhich);
}
```
        

and debugging / refactoring leftovers such as 


```java
// if (conditionThatIsNotUsedAnyLonger)
{
    System.out.println("unconditional");
}
```
        

A case in a switch statement does not implicitly form a block. Thus to be able to introduce local variables that have case scope it is necessary to open a nested block. This is supported, set the allowInSwitchCase property to true and include all statements of the case in the block. 


```java
switch (a)
{
    case 0:
        // Never OK, break outside block
        {
   x = 1;
        }
        break;
    case 1:
        // Never OK, statement outside block
        System.out.println("Hello");
        {
   x = 2;
   break;
        }
    case 1:
        // OK if allowInSwitchCase is true
        {
   System.out.println("Hello");
   x = 2;
   break;
        }
}
```
        

## Examples

To configure the check: 


```xml
<module name="AvoidNestedBlocks"/>
```
