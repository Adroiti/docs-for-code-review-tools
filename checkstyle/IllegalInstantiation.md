Pattern: Illegal instantiation where a factory method is preferred

Issue: -

## Description

Checks for illegal instantiations where a factory method is preferred. 

Rationale: Depending on the project, for some classes it might be preferable to create instances through factory methods rather than calling the constructor. 

A simple example is the `java.lang.Boolean` class. For performance reasons, it is preferable to use the predefined constants `TRUE` and `FALSE`. Constructor invocations should be replaced by calls to `Boolean.valueOf()`. 

Some extremely performance sensitive projects may require the use of factory methods for other classes as well, to enforce the usage of number caches or object pools. 

## Examples

To configure the check to find instantiations of `java.lang.Boolean`: 


```xml
<module name="IllegalInstantiation">
    <property name="classes" value="java.lang.Boolean"/>
</module>
```
