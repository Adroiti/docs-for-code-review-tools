Pattern: Possible issue in file header

Issue: -

## Description

Checks the header of a source file against a header that contains a [regular expression](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) for each line of the source header. 

Rationale: In some projects checking against a fixed header is not sufficient, e.g. the header might require a copyright line where the year information is not static. 

For example, consider the following header: 


```java
line  1: ^/{71}$
line  2: ^// checkstyle:$
line  3: ^// Checks Java source code for adherence to a set of rules\.$
line  4: ^// Copyright \(C\) \d\d\d\d  Oliver Burn$
line  5: ^// Last modification by \$Author.*\$$
line  6: ^/{71}$
line  7:
line  8: ^package
line  9:
line 10: ^import
line 11:
line 12: ^/\*\*
line 13: ^ \*([^/]|$)
line 14: ^ \*/
```
        

Lines 1 and 6 demonstrate a more compact notation for 71 '/' characters. Line 4 enforces that the copyright notice includes a four digit year. Line 5 is an example how to enforce revision control keywords in a file header. Lines 12-14 is a template for Javadoc (line 13 is so complicated to remove conflict with and of Javadoc comment). 

Different programming languages have different comment syntax rules, but all of them start a comment with a non-word character. Hence you can often use the non-word character class to abstract away the concrete comment syntax and allow checking the header for different languages with a single header definition. For example, consider the following header specification (note that this is not the full Apache license header): 


```java
line 1: ^#!
line 2: ^<\?xml.*>$
line 3: ^\W*$
line 4: ^\W*Copyright 2006 The Apache Software Foundation or its licensors, as applicable\.$
line 5: ^\W*Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2\.0 \(the "License"\);$
line 6: ^\W*$
```
        

Lines 1 and 2 leave room for technical header lines, e.g. the "#!/bin/sh" line in Unix shell scripts, or the XML file header of XML files. Set the multi-line property to "1, 2" so these lines can be ignored for file types where they do no apply. Lines 3 through 6 define the actual header content. Note how lines 2, 4 and 5 use escapes for characters that have special Regexp semantics. 

## Examples

In default configuration the check does not rise any violations. Default values of properties are used. 


```xml
<module name="RegexpHeader"/>
```
 

To configure the check to use header file `"config/java.header"` and `10` and `13` multi-lines: 


```xml
<module name="RegexpHeader">
    <property name="headerFile" value="config/java.header"/>
    <property name="multiLines" value="10, 13"/>
</module>
```
        

To configure the check to verify that each file starts with the header 


```java
^// Copyright \(C\) (\d\d\d\d -)? 2004 MyCompany$
^// All rights reserved$
```
        

without the need for an external header file: 


```xml
<module name="RegexpHeader">
  <property
    name="header"
    value="^// Copyright \(C\) (\d\d\d\d -)? 2004 MyCompany$\n^// All rights reserved$"/>
</module>
```
        

_Note_: `ignoreLines` property has been removed from this check to simplify it. To make some line optional use "^.*$" Regexp for this line.
