Pattern: Missing `this.` for method or instance variable

Issue: -

## Description

Checks that references to instance variables and methods of the present object are explicitly of the form `this.varName` or `this.methodName(args)` and that those references don't rely on the default behavior when `this.` is absent. 

Warning: the check is very controversial if `validateOnlyOverlapping` option is set to 'false' and not that actual nowadays. 

Rationale: 

  1. The same notation/habit for C++ and Java (C++ have global methods, so having `this.` do make sense in it to distinguish call of method of class instead of global). 
  2. Non-IDE development (ease of refactoring, some clearness to distinguish static and non-static methods). 

## Examples

To configure the default check: 


```xml
<module name="RequireThis"/>
```
        

To configure to check the `this` qualifier for fields only: 


```xml
<module name="RequireThis">
    <property name="checkMethods" value="false"/>
</module>
```
        

Examples of how the check works if validateOnlyOverlapping option is set to true: 


```java
public static class A {
  private int field1;
  private int field2;
 

  public A(int field1) {
    // Overlapping by constructor argument.
    field1 = field1; // violation: Reference to instance variable "field1" needs "this".
    field2 = 0;
  }
 

  void foo3() {
    String field1 = "values";
    // Overlapping by local variable.
    field1 = field1; // violation:  Reference to instance variable "field1" needs "this".
  }
}
 

public static class B {
  private int field1;
 

  public A(int f) {
    field1 = f;
  }
 

  String addSuffixToField(String field1) {
    // Overlapping by method argument. Equal to "return field1 = field1 + "suffix";"
    return field1 += "suffix"; // violation: Reference to instance variable "field1" needs "this".
  }
}
```
       

Please, be aware of the following logic, which is implemented in the check: 

1) If you arrange `this` in your code on your own, the check will not raise violation for variables which use `this` to reference a class field, for example: 


```java
public class C {
  private int scale;
  private int x;
  public void foo(int scale) {
    scale = this.scale; // no violation
    if (scale > 0) {
      scale = -scale; // no violation
    }
    x *= scale;
  }
}
```
       

2) If method parameter is returned from the method, the check will not raise violation for returned variable/parameter, for example: 


```java
public class D {
  private String prefix;
  public String modifyPrefix(String prefix) {
    prefix = "^" + prefix + "$" // no violation (modification of parameter)
    return prefix; // modified method parameter is returned from the method
  }
}
```
       

Examples of how the check works if validateOnlyOverlapping option is set to false: 


```java
public static class A {
  private int field1;
  private int field2;
 

  public A(int field1) {
    field1 = field1; // violation: Reference to instance variable "field1" needs "this".
    field2 = 0; // violation: Reference to instance variable "field2" needs "this".
    String field2;
    field2 = "0"; // No violation. Local var allowed
  }
 

  void foo3() {
    String field1 = "values";
    field1 = field1; // violation:  Reference to instance variable "field1" needs "this".
  }
}
 

public static class B {
  private int field1;
 

  public A(int f) {
    field1 = f; // violation:  Reference to instance variable "field1" needs "this".
  }
 

  String addSuffixToField(String field1) {
    return field1 += "suffix"; // violation: Reference to instance variable "field1" needs "this".
  }
}
 

// If the variable is locally defined, there won't be a violation provided the variable doesn't overlap.
class C {
  private String s1 = "foo1";
  String s2 = "foo2";
 

  C() {
      s1 = "bar1"; // Violation. Reference to instance variable 's1' needs "this.".
      String s2;
      s2 = "bar2"; // No violation. Local var allowed.
      s2 += s2; // Violation. Overlapping. Reference to instance variable 's2' needs "this.".
  }
}
```
