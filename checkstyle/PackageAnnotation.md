Pattern: Package annotation not in `package-info.java` file

Issue: -

## Description

This check makes sure that all package annotations are in the `package-info.java` file. 

Java Language Specification (JLS) does not enforce the placement of package annotations. This placement may vary based on implementation. The JLS does highly recommend that all package annotations are placed in the `package-info.java` file. See [Java Language Specification, section 7.4.1](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.4.1). 

## Examples

To configure the check:


```java
 <module name="PackageAnnotation"/>
```
