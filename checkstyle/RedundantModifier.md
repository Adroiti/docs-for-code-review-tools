Pattern: Redundant modifier

Issue: -

## Description

Checks for redundant modifiers in: 

  1. Interface and annotation definitions.
  2. Final modifier on methods of final and anonymous classes.
  3. Inner `interface` declarations that are declared as `static`. 
  4. Class constructors.
  5. Nested `enum` definitions that are declared as `static`. 

Rationale: The Java Language Specification strongly discourages the usage of `public` and `abstract` for method declarations in interface definitions as a matter of style. 

Interfaces by definition are abstract so the `abstract` modifier on the interface is redundant. 

Classes inside of interfaces by definition are public and static, so the `public` and `static` modifiers on the inner classes are redundant. On the other hand, classes inside of interfaces can be abstract or non abstract. So, `abstract` modifier is allowed. 

Fields in interfaces and annotations are automatically public, static and final, so these modifiers are redundant as well. 

As annotations are a form of interface, their fields are also automatically public, static and final just as their annotation fields are automatically public and abstract. 

Enums by definition are static implicit subclasses of `java.lang.Enum<E>`. So, the `static` modifier on the enums is redundant. In addition, if enum is inside of interface, `public` modifier is also redundant. 

Enums can also contain abstract methods and methods which can be overridden by the declared enumeration fields. See the following example: 


```java
 public enum EnumClass {
FIELD_1,
FIELD_2 {
    @Override
    public final void method1() {} // violation expected
};
 

public void method1() {}
public final void method2() {} // no violation expected
 }
```
        

Since these methods can be overridden in these situations, the final methods are not marked as redundant even though they can't be extended by other classes/enums. 

Nested `enum` types are always static by default. 

Final classes by definition cannot be extended so the `final` modifier on the method of a final class is redundant. 

Public modifier for constructors in non-public non-protected classes is always obsolete: 


```java
 public class PublicClass {
   public PublicClass() {} // OK
 }
 

 class PackagePrivateClass {
   public PackagePrivateClass() {} // violation expected
 }
```
        

There is no violation in the following example, because removing public modifier from ProtectedInnerClass constructor will make this code not compiling: 


```java
 package a;
 public class ClassExample {
   protected class ProtectedInnerClass {
 public ProtectedInnerClass () {}
   }
 }
 

 package b;
 import a.ClassExample;
 public class ClassExtending extends ClassExample {
   ProtectedInnerClass pc = new ProtectedInnerClass();
 }
```
        

## Examples

To configure the check: 


```xml
<module name="RedundantModifier"/>
```
        

To configure the check to check only methods and not variables: 


```xml
<module name="RedundantModifier">
  <property name="tokens" value="METHOD_DEF"/>
</module>
```
