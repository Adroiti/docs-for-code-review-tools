Pattern: Use of magic number

Issue: -

## Description

Checks that there are no ["magic numbers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_%28programming%29) where a magic number is a numeric literal that is not defined as a constant. By default, -1, 0, 1, and 2 are not considered to be magic numbers. 

It is fine to have one constant defining multiple numeric literals within one expression: 


```java
static final int SECONDS_PER_DAY = 24 * 60 * 60;
static final double SPECIAL_RATIO = 4.0 / 3.0;
static final double SPECIAL_SUM = 1 + Math.E;
static final double SPECIAL_DIFFERENCE = 4 - Math.PI;
static final Border STANDARD_BORDER = BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(3, 3, 3, 3);
static final Integer ANSWER_TO_THE_ULTIMATE_QUESTION_OF_LIFE = new Integer(42);
```
 

## Examples

To configure the check with default configuration: 


```xml
<module name="MagicNumber"/>
```
        

results is following violations: 


```java
@MyAnnotation(6) // violation
class MyClass {
    private field = 7; // violation
 

    void foo() {
       int i = i + 1; // no violation
       int j = j + 8; // violation
    }
}
```
        

To configure the check so that it checks floating-point numbers that are not 0, 0.5, or 1: 


```xml
<module name="MagicNumber">
    <property name="tokens" value="NUM_DOUBLE, NUM_FLOAT"/>
    <property name="ignoreNumbers" value="0, 0.5, 1"/>
    <property name="ignoreFieldDeclaration" value="true"/>
    <property name="ignoreAnnotation" value="true"/>
</module>
```
        

results is following violations: 


```java
@MyAnnotation(6) // no violation
class MyClass {
    private field = 7; // no violation
 

    void foo() {
       int i = i + 1; // no violation
       int j = j + 8; // violation
    }
}
```
        

Config Example for constantWaiverParentToken Option: 


```java
        <module name="MagicNumber">
   <property name="constantWaiverParentToken" value="ASSIGN,ARRAY_INIT,EXPR,
   UNARY_PLUS, UNARY_MINUS, TYPECAST, ELIST, DIV, PLUS "/>
        </module>
```
        

result is following violation:


```java
   class TestMethodCall {
      public void method2() {
  final TestMethodCall dummyObject = new TestMethodCall(62);//violation
  final int a = 3;    // ok as waiver is ASSIGN
  final int [] b = {4, 5} // ok as waiver is ARRAY_INIT
  final int c = -3;   // ok as waiver is UNARY_MINUS
  final int d = +4;   // ok as waiver is UNARY_PLUS
  final int e = method(1, 2) // ELIST is there but violation due to METHOD_CALL
  final int x = 3 * 4;// violation
  final int y = 3 / 4;// ok as waiver is DIV
  final int z = 3 + 4;// ok as waiver is PLUS
  final int w = 3 - 4;// violation
  final int x = (int)(3.4);//ok as waiver is TYPECAST
      }
   }
```
