Pattern: Malformed `@SuppressWarnings` annotation

Issue: -

## Description

Maintains a set of check suppressions from `@SuppressWarnings` annotations. It allows to prevent Checkstyle from reporting errors from parts of code that were annotated with `@SuppressWarnings` and using name of the check to be excluded. You can also define aliases for check names that need to be suppressed. 

## Examples

To prevent `FooCheck` errors from being reported write:


```java
        @SuppressWarnings("foo") interface I { }
        @SuppressWarnings("foo") enum E { }
        @SuppressWarnings("foo") InputSuppressWarningsFilter() { }
```
        

  


Some real check examples:

This will prevent from invocation of the MemberNameCheck: 


```java
@SuppressWarnings({"membername"})
private int J;
```
  

You can also use a `checkstyle` prefix to prevent compiler from processing this annotations. For example this will prevent ConstantNameCheck 


```java
   @SuppressWarnings("checkstyle:constantname")
   private static final int m = 0;
```
 

The general rule is that the argument of the `@SuppressWarnings` will be matched against class name of the checker in lower case and without `Check` suffix if present

If `aliasList` property was provided you can use your own names e.g below code will work if there was provided a `ParameterNumberCheck=paramnum` in the `aliasList`


```java
   @SuppressWarnings("paramnum")
   public void needsLotsOfParameters(@SuppressWarnings("unused") int a,
 int b, int c, int d, int e, int f, int g, int h) {
 ...
   }
```
 

It is possible to suppress all the checkstyle warnings with the argument `"all"`: 


```java
   @SuppressWarnings("all")
   public void someFunctionWithInvalidStyle() {
 //...
   }
```
