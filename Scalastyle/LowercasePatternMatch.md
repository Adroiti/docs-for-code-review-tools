Pattern: Lowercase pattern match

Issue: -

## Description

A lower case pattern match clause with no other tokens is the same as `_`. This is not true for patterns which start with an upper case letter. This can cause confusion, and may not be what was intended:

```scala
val foo = "foo"
val Bar = "bar"
"bar" match { case Bar => "we got bar" }   // result = "we got bar"
"bar" match { case foo => "we got foo" }   // result = "we got foo"
"bar" match { case `foo` => "we got foo" } // result = MatchError
```

This rule raises a warning with the second match. To fix it, use an identifier which starts with an upper case letter (best), use `case _` or, if you wish to refer to the value, add a type `: Any`

```scala
val lc = "lc"
"something" match { case lc: Any => "lc" } // result = "lc"
"something" match { case _ => "lc" } // result = "lc"
```

## Example configuration

```xml
<check enabled="true" class="org.scalastyle.scalariform.LowercasePatternMatchChecker" level="warning"/>
```
<a name="org_scalastyle_scalariform_MagicNumberChecker" />
