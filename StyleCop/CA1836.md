Pattern: Use of `Count` instead of `IsEmpty`

Issue: -

## Description

The `Count` or `Length` property or the `Count<TSource>(IEnumerable<TSource>)` extension method was used to determine whether or not the object contains any items by comparing the value to `0` or `1`, and the object has a more efficient `IsEmpty` property that could be used instead.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```cs
class Test
{
    ConcurrentQueue<int> _queue;
    public bool HasNoItems => _queue.Count == 0;
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```cs
class Test
{
    ConcurrentQueue<int> _queue;
    public bool HasNoItems => _queue.IsEmpty;
}
```
