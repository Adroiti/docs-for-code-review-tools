Pattern: Use of `Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainModule.FileName`

Issue: -

## Description

`System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainModule.FileName` is expensive:

    It allocates a `Process` and `ProcessModule` instance, usually just to get the `FileName`.
    The `Process` instance needs to be disposed, which has a performance impact.
    It's easy to forget to call `Dispose()` on the `Process` instance.
    If nothing else besides `FileName` uses the `Process` instance, then the linked size grows unnecessarily by increasing the graph of types referenced.
    It is somewhat difficult to discover or find this API.

`System.Environment.ProcessPath` avoids all of these downsides and produces the same information.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```cs
string path = Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainModule.FileName;
```

Example of **correct** code:

```cs
string path = System.Environment.ProcessPath;
```
