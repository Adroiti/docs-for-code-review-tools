Pattern: Unnecessary call to `Contains()` for sets

Issue: -

## Description

Both `ISet<T>.Add(T)` and `ICollection<T>.Remove(T)` perform a lookup, which makes it redundant to call `ICollection<T>.Contains(T)` beforehand. It's more efficient to call `Add(T)` or `Remove(T)` directly, which returns a Boolean value indicating whether the item was added or removed.

This logic also applies to `IImmutableSet<T>.Add(T)` and `IImmutableSet<T>.Remove(T)`, except that they either return a new set if the item is added or removed, or the original set if it wasn't.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```cs
void Run(ISet<string> set)
{
    if (!set.Contains("Hello World"))
    {
        set.Add("Hello World");
    }
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```cs
void Run(ISet<string> set)
{
    set.Add("Hello World");
}
```
