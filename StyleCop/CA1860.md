Pattern: Use of `Enumerable.Any()` extension method

Issue: -

## Description

To determine whether a collection type has any elements, it's more efficient and clearer to use the `Length`, `Count`, or `IsEmpty` (if possible) properties than to call the `Enumerable.Any` method.

`Any()`, which is an extension method, uses language integrated query (LINQ). It's more efficient to rely on the collection's own properties, and it also clarifies intent.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```cs
bool HasElements(string[] strings)
{
    return strings.Any();
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```cs
bool HasElements(string[] strings)
{
    return strings.Length > 0;
}
```
