Pattern: Missing use of `nameof`

Issue: -

## Description

`nameof` improves code maintainability in cases where the parameter may be renamed in the future, but the string literal is mistakenly not renamed. By using `nameof`, the symbol will be renamed when the parameter is renamed through a refactoring operation.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```cs
public Book(string title)
{
    // Violates rule CA1507
    Title = title ?? throw new ArgumentNullException("title", "All books must have a title.");
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```cs
public Book(string title)
{
    // Resolves rule CA1507 violation
    Title = title ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(title), "All books must have a title.");
}
```
