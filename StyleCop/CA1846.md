Pattern: Use of `Substring()` over `AsSpan()`

Issue: -

## Description

`Substring` allocates a new `string` object on the heap and performs a full copy of the extracted text. String manipulation is a performance bottleneck for many programs. Allocating many small, short-lived strings on a hot path can create enough collection pressure to impact performance. The O(n) copies created by `Substring` become relevant when the substrings get large. The `Span<T>` and `ReadOnlySpan<T>` types were created to solve these performance problems.

Many APIs that accept strings also have overloads that accept a `ReadOnlySpan<System.Char>` argument. When such overloads are available, you can improve performance by calling `AsSpan` instead of `Substring`.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```cs
public void TestMethod(string iniFileLine)
{
    // Violation
    int.TryParse(iniFileLine.Substring(7), out int x);
    int.TryParse(iniFileLine.Substring(2, 5), out int y);
}
```

Example of **correct** code:

```cs
public void TestMethod(string iniFileLine)
{
    // Fix
    int.TryParse(iniFileLine.AsSpan(7), out int x);
    int.TryParse(iniFileLine.AsSpan(2, 5), out int y);
}
```
