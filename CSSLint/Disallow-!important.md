Pattern: Disallow !important

Issue: Use of !important

## Description

The `!important` annotation is used to artificially increase the specificity of a given property value in a rule. This is usually an indication that the specificity of the entire CSS has gotten a bit out of control and needs to be refactored. The more frequently `!important` is found in CSS, the more likely it is that developers are having trouble styling parts of a page effectively.

## Rule Details

Rule ID: `important`

This rule is aimed at keeping your specificity levels in check. As such, it warns whenever `!important` is used.

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```css
.mybox {
    color: red !important;
}
```
