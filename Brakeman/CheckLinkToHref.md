Pattern: Potentially unsafe model attribute in `link_to`

Issue: -

## Description

Checks for calls to `link_to` which pass in potentially hazardous data to the second argument.  While this argument must be `html_safe` to not break the html, it must also be url safe as determined by calling a
`:url_safe_method`.  This prevents attacks such as `javascript:evil()` or `data:<encoded XSS>` which is `html_safe`, but not safe as an href.
