Pattern: Missing version for `zypper install`

Issue: -

## Description

Version pinning forces the build to retrieve a particular version regardless of whatâ€™s in the cache. This technique can also reduce failures due to unanticipated changes in required packages.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.2
RUN zypper install -y httpd && zypper clean
```

Example of **correct** code:

RUN zypper install -y httpd=2.4.46 && zypper clean
```
