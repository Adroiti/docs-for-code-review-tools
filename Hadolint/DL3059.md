Issue: -

## Description

On of the first points in the Docker best practices is that one should merge multiple `RUN` instructions into one, where possible to reduce the layer count.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
RUN /one.sh
RUN /two.sh
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
RUN /one.sh
WORKDIR /
RUN /two.sh
```
