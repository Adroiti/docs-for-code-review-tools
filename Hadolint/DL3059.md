Pattern: Use of multiple consecutive `RUN`

Issue: -

## Description

Each `RUN` instruction will create a new layer in the resulting image. Therefore consolidating consecutive `RUN` instructions will reduce the layer count (see https://docs.docker.com/develop/dev-best-practices/).
In addition to that, each `RUN` runs in its own shell, which can be the source of confusion when part of a `RUN` instruction changes something about the environment, because these changes may vanish in the next `RUN` instruction.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
RUN command1
RUN command2
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
RUN command1 \
 && command2
```

## Drawbacks

Please review Docker's layer caching. In general you want layers first which don't change often, so they can be cached. Putting easy cacheable and non-cacheable commands in the same layer (by using one `RUN` command) might have negative performance issues. You might want to ignore this `info` level rule.
