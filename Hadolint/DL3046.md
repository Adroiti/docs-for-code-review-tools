Pattern: Use of `useradd` without flag `-l` and high UID

Issue: -

## Description

Docker can run into problems when using the command `useradd` without the `-l` option. This is because a large sparse logfile is created by that command and the overlay filesystem may have trouble dealing with that. The `-l` option disables the creation, thus avoiding the whole problem.
