Pattern: Missing `-y` for `dnf install -y <package>`

Issue: -

## Description

Omitting the non-interactive switch causes the command to fail during the build process, because `dnf` would expect manual input. Use the `-y` or the equivalent `--assumeyes` flag to avoid this.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
FROM fedora:32
RUN dnf install httpd-2.4.46 && dnf clean all
```
