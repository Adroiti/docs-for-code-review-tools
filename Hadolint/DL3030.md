Pattern: Missing `-y` flag for `yum`

Issue: -

## Description

Without the `-y` flag or the equivalent `--assumeyes` flag, yum will not successfully install a package, because human input is expected. The `-y` flag makes yum assume 'yes' as the answer to prompts during the installation.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
FROM centos
RUN yum install httpd-2.24.4 && yum clean all
```
