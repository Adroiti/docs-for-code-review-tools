Version pinning forces the build to retrieve a particular version regardless of whatâ€™s in the cache. This technique can also reduce failures due to unanticipated changes in required packages.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
RUN dnf install -y httpd && dnf clean all
```

Example of **correct** code:
