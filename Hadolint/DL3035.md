Pattern: Use of `zypper update`

Issue: -

## Description

This rule lints against blanket updates and dist-upgrades, but allows more specific updates by two methods:

- use `zypper install -y $PACKAGE>=$VERSION` to upgrade a particular package, giving a version requirement.
- use `zypper patch` to mitigate particular security vulnerabilities.

Problems include:

- updates failing on packages from base images in unprivileged containers
- inconsistencies between builds producing problems for application developers


Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.2
RUN zypper update -y
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.2
RUN zypper install -y httpd\>=2.4 && zypper clean
RUN zypper patch --cve=cve-2015-7547 && zypper clean
```
