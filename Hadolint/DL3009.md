Pattern: Missing cleanup for `apt-get`

Issue: -

## Description

Cleaning up the apt cache and removing `/var/lib/apt/lists` helps keep the image size down. Since the `RUN` statement starts with `apt-get update`, the package cache will always be refreshed prior to `apt-get install`.

Clean up must be performed in the same RUN step, otherwise it will affect image size.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python \
 && apt-get clean \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```
