Pattern: Missing `HEALTHCHECK` instruction

Issue: -

## Description

When it is required to define a health check (e.g. by company policy), it must not be omitted.

This rule is disabled by default, because a `HEALTHCHECK` is not desirable in all circumstances. Images used with Kubernetes for example do not benefit from a `HEALTHCHECK` instruction, as Kubernetes brings its own mechanisms to accomplish the same thing. If however it is desired, this rule makes sure a build stage either has a `HEALTHCHECK` instruction, or inherits it from an earlier build stage.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
HEALTHCHECK CMD /bin/health
```
