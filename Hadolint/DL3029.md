Pattern: Use of `--platform=` with `FROM`

Issue: -

## Description

Specifying `--platform=` in the docker file `FROM` clause forces the Image to build only one target platform. This has a number of negative consequences:

- It is not possible to build a multi-platform Image from this Docker file.
- The platform that you build on must be the same as the platform specified in `--platform=`

A better approach is to omit `FROM --platform` in the docker file and to specify in `buildx --platform=` during the build if control of the image platform target is needed.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```dockerfile
FROM --platform=x86 busybox
```

Example of **correct** code:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
```
