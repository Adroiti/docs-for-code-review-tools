Pattern: Malformed indentation

Issue: -

## Description

Checks the indentation (spaces only; not tabs) for class, field and method declarations, and statements.

This rule is limited, and somewhat opinionated. The default is 4 spaces per indentation level.

| **Property**         | **Description**                                                  | **Default Value** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| spacesPerIndentLevel | The number of spaces that make up a single level of indentation. | 4                 |

Known Limitations include:

-   Checks spaces only (not tabs)
-   Does not check comments
-   Does not check line-continuations (i.e., checks only the first line of a statement)
-   Does not check multiple statements/members on the same line (only checks the first one)
-   Does not check Map entry expressions
-   Does not check calls to `this()` and `super()` within a constructor
-   When classes, methods or fields have annotations, the indentation of the annotation is checked, not the actual member. And only the first annotation is checked, if there is more than one.

Example of violations:

``` groovy
// Indent Levels:
0...1...2...3...4...5

class MyClass {                                 // CORRECT
protected int count                         // CORRECT
  private static final NAME = "Joe"             // violation
       def max, min                         // violation on "max" only

 private String doStuff() {                     // violation
    def internalCounts = [1, 4, 2]          // CORRECT
        id.trim()                           // violation
}

private void executeOtherOne() {            // CORRECT
    try {
      executeWithArgs(args)                 // violation
    } catch(Throwable t) {
                   t.printStackTrace()      // violation
    }
    finally {
            closeResources()                // violation
    }
}
}
```
