Pattern: Unnecessary `;`

Issue: -

## Description

Semicolons as line terminators are not required in Groovy: remove them. Do not use a semicolon as a replacement for empty braces on for and while loops; this is a confusing practice.

The rule contains a String property called `excludePattern`. Any source code line matching this pattern will not trigger a violation. The default value is '\\s?\\\*.\*|/\\\*.\*|.\*//.\*|.\*\\\*/.\*' This is to filter out comments. Any source line that even looks like it is a comment is ignored.

\\s?\*.\* == whitespace plus star character plus anything /\*.\* == any line that contains the /\* sequence .\*//.\* == any line that contains the // sequence .\*\*/.\* == any line that contains the \*/ sequence

Example of violations:

``` groovy
package some.company.server;  // violation

import java.lang.String;    // violation

println(value) ;             // violation

for (def x : list);         // violation

// this code is OK
println(value); println (otherValue)
```
