Pattern: Class has too many methods

Issue: -

## Description

Checks if the number of methods within a class exceeds the number of lines specified by the **maxMethod** property.

A class with too many methods is probably a good suspect for refactoring, in order to reduce its complexity and find a way to have more fine grained objects.

| **Property** | **Description**                                              | **Default Value** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| maxMethods   | The maximum number of methods allowed in a class definition. | 30                |
