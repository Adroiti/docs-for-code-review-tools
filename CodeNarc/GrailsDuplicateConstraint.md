Pattern: Grails - duplicate constraint

Issue: -

## Description

Checks for duplicate name in a Grails domain class constraints. Duplicate names/entries are legal, but can be confusing and error-prone.

NOTE: This rule does not check that the values of the entries are duplicated, only that there are two entries with the same name.

Example of violations:

``` groovy
class Person {
    String firstName
    String lastName

    static constraints = {
        firstName nullable:true
        lastName nullable:true, maxSize:30
        firstName nullable:false                // violation
    }
}
```
