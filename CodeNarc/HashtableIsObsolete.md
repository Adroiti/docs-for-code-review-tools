Pattern: Use of `Hashtable`

Issue: -

## Description

Checks for references to the (*effectively*) obsolete `java.util.Hashtable` class. Use the **Java Collections Framework** classes instead, including `HashMap` or `ConcurrentHashMap`. See the JDK javadoc.

Note: As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, this class was retrofitted to implement the `Map` interface, making it a member of the Java Collections Framework. Unlike the new collection implementations, `Hashtable` is synchronized. If a thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use `HashMap` in place of `Hashtable`. If a thread-safe highly-concurrent implementation is desired, then it is recommended to use `ConcurrentHashMap` in place of `Hashtable`.

Example of violations:

``` groovy
def someMap = new Hashtable()           // violation
```
