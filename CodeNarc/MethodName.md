Pattern: Invalid method name

Issue: -

## Description

Verifies that the name of each method matches a regular expression. By default it checks that the method name starts with a lowercase letter. Implicit method names are ignored (i.e., 'main' and 'run' methods automatically created for Groovy scripts).
