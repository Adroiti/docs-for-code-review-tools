Pattern: C.R.A.P. score is too high

Issue: -

## Description

Calculates the <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=210575" class="externalLink">C.R.A.P.</a> (Change Risk Anti-Patterns) metric score for methods/classes and checks against configured threshold values.

The *CRAP* metric score is based on the *cyclomatic complexity* and test coverage for individual methods. A method with a *CRAP* value greater than the **maxMethodCrapScore** property causes a violation. Likewise, a class that has an (average method) *CRAP* value greater than the **maxClassAverageMethodCrapScore** property causes a violation.

The **maxMethodCrapScore** property holds the threshold value for the CRAP value for each method. If this value is non-zero, a method with a cyclomatic complexity value greater than this value is considered a violation.

The **maxClassAverageMethodCrapScore** property holds the threshold value for the average CRAP value for each class. If this value is non-zero, a class with an average cyclomatic complexity value greater than this value is considered a violation.

NOTE: This rule does NOT treat *closure fields* as methods (unlike some of the other size/complexity rules).

| --- | --- | --- |
| coberturaXmlFile               | The path to the Cobertura XML coverage file for the Groovy code By default, the path is relative to the classpath. But the path may be optionally prefixed by any of the valid java.net.URL prefixes, such as "file:" (to load from a relative or absolute path on the filesystem), or "http:". This property is REQUIRED. | `null`            |
| maxMethodCrapScore             | The maximum *CRAP* metric value allowed for a single method. If zero or *null*, then do not check method-level complexity.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 30                |
| maxClassAverageMethodCrapScore | The maximum *CRAP* average metric value allowed for a class, calculated as the average CRAP value of its methods. If zero or *null*, then do not check the average class-level CRAP value.                                                                                                                                 | 30                |
| maxClassCrapScore              | The maximum total *CRAP* metric value allowed for a class, calculated as the total CRAP value of its methods. If zero or *null*, then do not check class-level CRAP value.                                                                                                                                                 | 0                 |
| ignoreMethodNames              | Specifies one or more (comma-separated) method names that that should not cause a rule violation. The names may optionally contain wildcards (\*,?). Note that the ignored methods still contribute to the class complexity value.                                                                                         | `null`            |
## CRAP Formula

Given a Groovy method `m`, C.R.A.P. for `m` is calculated as follows:

``` groovy
  C.R.A.P.(m) = comp(m)^2 * (1 - cov(m)/100)^3 + comp(m)
```

Where **comp(m)** is the *cyclomatic complexity* of method m, and **cov(m)** is the test code coverage provided by automated tests.
