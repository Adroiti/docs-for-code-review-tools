Pattern: ABC score is too high

Issue: -

## Description

Calculates the *ABC* size metric for methods/classes and checks against configured threshold values.

The **maxMethodAbcScore** property holds the threshold value for the ABC score for each method. If this value is non-zero, a method with an ABC score greater than this value is considered a violation. The value does not have to be an integer (e.g., 1.7 is allowed).

The **maxClassAverageMethodAbcScore** property holds the threshold value for the average ABC score for each class. If this value is non-zero, a class with an average ABC score value greater than this value is considered a violation. The value does not have to be an integer.

The **maxClassAbcScore** property holds the threshold value for the total ABC score value for each class. If this value is non-zero, a class with a total ABC score greater than this value is considered a violation. The value does not have to be an integer.

This rule treats "closure fields" as methods. If a class field is initialized to a Closure (ClosureExpression), then that Closure is analyzed and checked just like a method.

| **Property**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Default Value** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| maxMethodAbcScore             | The maximum *ABC* score allowed for a single method (or "closure field"). If zero or *null*, then do not check method-level scores.                                                                                                | 60                |
| maxClassAverageMethodAbcScore | The maximum average *ABC* score allowed for a class, calculated as the average score of its methods or "closure fields". If zero or *null*, then do not check class-level average scores.                                          | 60                |
| maxClassAbcScore              | The maximum *ABC* score allowed for a class, calculated as the total ABC score of its methods or "closure fields". If zero or *null*, then do not check class-level scores.                                                        | 0                 |
| ignoreMethodNames             | Specifies one or more (comma-separated) method names that that should not cause a rule violation. The names may optionally contain wildcards (\*,?). Note that the ignored methods still contribute to the class complexity value. | `null`            |

## ABC Size Metric Calculation Rules

The *ABC* score is calculated as follows: The *ABC* metric measures size by counting the number of Assignments (A), Branches (B) and Conditions (C) and assigns a single numerical score calculated as:

` |ABC| = sqrt((A*A)+(B*B)+(C*C)) `

The *ABC Metric* calculation rules for Groovy:

-   Add one to the *assignment* count for each occurrence of an assignment operator, excluding constant declarations: = \*= /= %= += **=** = &= |= ^= &gt;&gt;&gt;=
-   Add one to the *assignment* count for each occurrence of an increment or decrement operator (prefix or postfix): ++ --
-   Add one to the *branch* count for each function call or class method call.
-   Add one to the *branch* count for each occurrence of the new operator.
-   Add one to the *condition* count for each use of a conditional operator: `== != *=* = ** *=* =~ ==~`
-   Add one to the *condition* count for each use of the following keywords: else case default try catch ?
-   Add one to the *condition* count for each unary conditional expression.
