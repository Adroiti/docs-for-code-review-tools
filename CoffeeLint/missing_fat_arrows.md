Pattern: Missing fat arrow

Issue: -

## Description

Warns when you use `this` inside a function that wasn't defined with a fat arrow. This rule does not apply to methods defined in a class, since they have `this` bound to the class instance (or the class itself, for class methods). 

The option `is_strict` is available for checking bindings of class methods. It is impossible to statically determine whether a function using `this` will be bound with the correct `this` value due to language features like `Function.prototype.call` and `Function.prototype.bind`, so this rule may produce false positives.
