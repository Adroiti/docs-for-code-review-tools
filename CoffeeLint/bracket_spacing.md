Pattern: Malformed bracket spacing

Issue: -

## Description

This rule checks to see that there is the proper spacing inside square
brackets. The spacing amount is specified by `spaces`. The spacing
amount for empty arrays is specified by `empty_array_spaces`. The
spacing amount for arrays containing a single item is specified by
`mono_array_spaces`. Specified characters will be ignored if listed in `exceptions`.

## Examples

``` coffeescript
# Spaces is 0
[a, b]     # Good
[a, b ]    # Bad
[ a, b]    # Bad
[ a, b ]   # Bad
# Except brackets
[ [a, b] ] # Good
[[ a, b ]] # Bad
# Spaces is 1
[a, b]     # Bad
[a, b ]    # Bad
[ a, b]    # Bad
[ a, b ]   # Good
[ a, b  ]  # Bad
[  a, b ]  # Bad
[  a, b  ] # Bad
# Except braces
[{ a: b }] # Good
[ {a: b} ] # Bad
# Empty Array Spaces is 0
[]         # Good
[ ]        # Bad
# Empty Array Spaces is 1
[]         # Bad
[ ]        # Good
# Mono Array Spaces is 0
[a]        # Good
[ a ]      # Bad
# Mono Array Spaces is 1
[a]        # Bad
[ a ]      # Good
```

This rule is disabled by default.
