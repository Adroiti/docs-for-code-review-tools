Pattern: Unnecessary double quotes

Issue: -

## Description

This rule prohibits double quotes unless string interpolation is used or the string contains single quotes.

## Examples

``` coffeescript
# Double quotes are discouraged:
foo = "bar"


# Unless string interpolation is used:
foo = "#{bar}baz"


# Or they prevent cumbersome escaping:
foo = "I'm just following the 'rules'"
```
